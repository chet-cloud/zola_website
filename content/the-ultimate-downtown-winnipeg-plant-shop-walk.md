<p>One of the best parts about apartment living downtown is that you don't have to go far to get fresh. Fresh produce, herbs, and plants for your place are all just a short walk away!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Downtown Winnipeg is full of fantastic nurseries, boutiques, shops, and even Farmers' Markets to fulfill your plant needs. Meaning you don't have to leave the comfort of Downtown to fill your place with flowers! I shopped all the plant shops till I dropped and found the perfect plant shop walk! Plan and know exactly where you're going to stop with this retail guide to houseplant shopping in Downtown Winnipeg!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These places are great for people like me who must do all or most of their gardening inside and whose thumb is still turning green; you'll be sure to find lots of easy to keep indoor plants for your apartment paradise. This is an excellent shop-walk because, best and first, the places on this guide are all a short walk from each other, making them a short walk from you - not to mention it makes a lovely afternoon stroll through Downtown.</p>

<p>You will find everything you need, from the perfect plant for your pad and the ideal pots and hangers and tools the tools you need to repot them. Best of all, you will receive great help and advice from all the helpful staff you meet at the stores! The only problem is - you'll want to carry <em>everything</em> back with you (but hey, where there's a will, there is a way, especially if you're prepared, right?)</p>

<h2><strong>The Forks Trading Company</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can't be plant shopping Downtown without stopping in at Winnipeg's most well-known spot for fresh and local, The Forks! The Forks has been one of Winnipeg's most notorious spots for local food, hand-crafted products, unique shops, and plants for over 30 years already.</p>
