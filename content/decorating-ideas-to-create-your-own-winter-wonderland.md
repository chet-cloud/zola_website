<p>Winter is just around the corner, and this is the most beautiful season for many winter-lovers. Houses covered with snow, the Christmas feeling, and the chilly weather make this season magical.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s also the coziest of the season. The cold push us back home, and there’s a unique vibe when drinking a warm cup of coffee in the comfort of your winter-decorated home. If you didn’t have time or energy to make your home your winter wonderland and are feeling overwhelmed, I’ve curated a few -easy- tips to make your home décor a little more winter-friendly.</p>

<h3>Light, Scent, and set the Mood with Candles</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nothing sets more a cozier mood than candles. Used all year long, your candle’s size, shape, and smell vary depending on your taste. However, the idea is to use it to highlight those winter prime spaces, like fireplaces, mantels, and shelves, to make your apartment or house even cozier. Keep the colors on the light and bright side for a minimalist look. Scents like peppermint, pine, and apple are great options to fill your home with the perfect winter vibe. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Make a wreath</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The front door is the first impression of your home. So why leave it out of the décor plan? The good thing about wreaths is that many options for inexpensive DIYs are available, so there are no excuses not to give them a try. &nbsp;Experiment with different materials like grapevine, Styrofoam, pinecones, or even cardboard. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Throw a blanket</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes! It’s that time of the year where we are so proud of our chunky knit blanket. If you don’t have the chunky one, any type will do it. Throw it on your sofa, stool, or bed. The blanket will add a touch of winter décor to your space with an inexpensive, warming, and elegant result.</p>

<h3>Flowers, plants, and greenery</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t wait for the Spring to enjoy your pretty flowers. Many flowers and plants survive and even thrive during winter’s cold weather<a href="https://livingat300main.ca/amazing-houseplants-that-will-survive-the-cold-weather/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">. <strong>A few days ago, we posted the best houseplants to survive the winter</strong></a>, but now we invite you to give it a try and decorate your home with flowers, foliage, or plants that will brighten up the cold season. To create a cozier look, choose earthier or white colors for flowers. Another good idea is to create a winter arrangement with bright foliage, branches, and berries.</p>

<h3>Bring the Outdoors in</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fun idea to give your house a wintery feeling is to bring outdoor elements inside. Rocks, firewood, pinecones, and leaves can create a cozier environment and add a cabin vibe to your favorite space. Keeping firewood displayed or winter greenery in ceramic vases adds another layer of natural textures to even the most urban of the homes.   </p>
