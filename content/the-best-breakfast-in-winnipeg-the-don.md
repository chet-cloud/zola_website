People say breakfast is the easiest thing to make, but this picky eater and breakfast aficionado begs to differ. Sure, anyone can make breakfast, but not everyone can make an exceptional breakfast.
<h3>The Don Tops the List</h3>
A few key elements separate just-okay restaurants from the very best: atmosphere, food quality (of course!), and cost. It takes a welcoming environment, friendly staff and home-cooked food with restaurant-quality taste to deliver a great dining experience. <a href="https://www.thedonrestaurantwinnipeg.com/">The Don</a> tops my list by delivering all of that, with solid <a href="https://www.thedonrestaurantwinnipeg.com/menu-breakfast">breakfast options</a> ranging from $5 to $10.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5765" src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4450-2-1024x768.jpg" alt="Breakfast place in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Breakfast, Breakfast place in downtown Winnipeg, downtown winnipeg living, living in downtown winnipeg" width="1024" height="768" />

One of the best things about living downtown is being able to take a short walk, bike or drive to a fresh sit-down breakfast. Located at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Don+Restaurant/@49.888203,-97.1428507,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x52ea7156cfd74ea7:0x41f5c1417266be27!8m2!3d49.888203!4d-97.140662">120 Donald Street</a> (near Broadway), The Don is right in the heart of downtown Winnipeg. The diner itself is large, but has a cozy, welcoming atmosphere. Served by friendly and personable staff, the food really shines. With a good variety to choose from—including smoothies and reasonably-priced <a href="https://www.thedonrestaurantwinnipeg.com/menu-features">breakfast specials</a>—there’s something on the menu for <em>everyone</em> (why hello there, potato dill pancakes!). Each dish has a home-cooked feel and tastes delicious; you can even sub perogies for hash browns. Try it out, and you might find yourself becoming a regular!
<h3>Work or Play, A Great Start Either Way</h3>
The Don delivers the best breakfast in Winnipeg, thanks to its wonderful staff, scrumptious food, and affordable menu. Conveniently located and open early (it’s <a href="https://www.thedonrestaurantwinnipeg.com/contact-us">open daily</a> from 7 am to 3:30 pm), The Don is a great place start to your day, any day of the week.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5767" src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4437-2-1024x768.jpg" alt="Breakfast place in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Breakfast, Breakfast place in downtown Winnipeg, downtown winnipeg living, living in downtown winnipeg" width="1024" height="768" />

Near main bus routes and just a brief stroll from the stop at <a href="https://m.viarail.ca/en/WinnipegStation">Union Station</a>, The Don is easy to get to and from. If you’re spending your day out and about, it’s also within walking distance to <a href="https://www.theforks.com/">The Forks</a>, <a href="https://www.bellmtsplace.ca/">Bell MTS Place</a> and <a href="https://portageplace.ca/">Portage Place</a>. Getting to the top of my list isn’t easy, but when it comes to breakfast I always know where I want to go.
