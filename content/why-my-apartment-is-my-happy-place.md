excerpt: 'You’ve had a hectic day at work. You were a responsible adult and ran all
  your errands. And now, you’re exhausted. Luckily, you live right downtown so you
  make your way home quickly. You swing open the door to your apartment and you immediately
  feel the tension leave your body. Aaaaah: you’re home, with the pet, people, or
  peaceful solitude that you love. '

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">What My Apartment Means to Me</span></b></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">My apartment is my sanctuary</span><span data-contrast="auto">—my </span><span data-contrast="auto">little piece of space that’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">all </span><span data-contrast="auto">my own. Between a career, a social life, community involvement, side projects, </span><span data-contrast="auto">and </span><span data-contrast="auto">whatever else it throws at you, life can be both exhilarating and debilitating. </span><span data-contrast="auto">My apartment is where I can </span><span data-contrast="auto">step away from it all and relax. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And when I’m </span><span data-contrast="auto">recharged and ready to take on the world again</span><span data-contrast="auto">, my apartment is right in the middle of where I want to be</span><span data-contrast="auto">!</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">I’ve chosen to live in an apartment almost </span><span data-contrast="auto">as long as</span><span data-contrast="auto"> I’ve lived in Winnipeg. It fits my lifestyle</span><span data-contrast="auto">: </span><span data-contrast="auto">I get to come home to a secured, maintained property (two fewer things </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">I</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> have to worry about!)</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> which means I have more time to spend hanging out with friends, trying out new recipes</span><span data-contrast="auto">, or </span><span data-contrast="auto">just bumming around in my </span><span data-contrast="auto">pyjamas</span><span data-contrast="auto">. After living downtown for a few years and then </span><span data-contrast="auto">(</span><span data-contrast="auto">foolishly</span><span data-contrast="auto">)</span><span data-contrast="auto"> thinking a place at the edge of the city would be nice, I was only too happy to move back into the center of everything.</span>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Why I Want to Live Downtown</span></b></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Downtown </span><span data-contrast="auto">has</span><span data-contrast="auto"> everything I’m looking for in a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> location</span><span data-contrast="auto">, with a huge variety of businesses and services within </span><span data-contrast="auto">easy </span><span data-contrast="auto">walking distance. I’m elated to be in the middle of the city with so many fantastic things</span><span data-contrast="auto"> at my fingertips</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Here are my top 5 downtown highlight</span><span data-contrast="auto">s!</span>

https://livingat300main.ca/why-i-choose-to-live-downtown/

<b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Fantastic food
</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Winnipeg has a fantastic food scene and I’ll all about it. From fresh </span><a href="https://bronuts.ca/"><span data-contrast="none">gourmet doughnuts</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, to </span><a href="https://www.thetallestpoppy.com/menu"><span data-contrast="none">chicken and waffles</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, to stellar </span><a href="https://phohoang.com/"><span data-contrast="none">Vietnamese</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, if there is a particular cuisine you’re craving or you’re </span><span data-contrast="auto">just </span><span data-contrast="auto">looking to grab a good cup of joe, </span><span data-contrast="auto">there’s something </span><span data-contrast="auto">nearby to fulfil</span><span data-contrast="auto">l </span><span data-contrast="auto"> your foodie desires.</span>

<b><span data-contrast="auto">2. The vistas
</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">One of my favourite things about my apartment is that it’s in a gorgeous location. To be </span><span data-contrast="auto">in the midst of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a busy city and surrounded by public parks and beautiful historical buildings is a dream. I love green space</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> so in the summer there</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">nothing better than being able to walk a few blocks and spend the afternoon reading a book in the grass and </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">sunshine. Plus, there are some breathtaking views! I suggest a good wander around The Exchange for the architecture</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">or </span><span data-contrast="auto">timing it so you’re </span><span data-contrast="auto">on one of the many bridges overlooking the river at sunset.</span>

<b><span data-contrast="auto">3. There is </span></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">always </span></i></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">something going on
</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Areas like </span><span data-contrast="auto">t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he </span><a href="https://exchangedistrict.org/"><span data-contrast="none">Exchange</span><span data-contrast="none"> District</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://www.theforks.com/"><span data-contrast="none">T</span><span data-contrast="none">he Forks</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.osbornevillage.com/"><span data-contrast="none">Osborne Village</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> are some of the most popular spots in Winnipeg</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Downtown is close to all of them, giving you</span><span data-contrast="auto"> all kinds of opportunities for adventure. There are always interesting activities to take part in, like swing dancing, weekly markets, and music festivals. I really enjoy that I can just wander over to the unique shops, restaurants and venues </span><span data-contrast="auto">that surround Winnipeg’s downtown.</span>

<b><span data-contrast="auto">4. It’s easy to be spontaneous
</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">When you’re downtown, </span><span data-contrast="auto">music, film, theatre, art, </span><span data-contrast="auto">and </span><span data-contrast="auto">history</span><span data-contrast="auto"> are</span><span data-contrast="auto"> practically at your doorstep. It’s much easier to be spontaneous when going out doesn’t involve a lot of meticulous planning. The fact that I can indulge in some live music or an afternoon at the </span><a href="https://wag.ca/"><span data-contrast="none">WAG</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> when I feel like it means I’m much m</span><span data-contrast="auto">ore likely </span><span data-contrast="auto">to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> do so.</span>

<b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Public transportation
</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">As a non-driver, I really appreciate that when I need to get somewhere, there are plenty of transit options. </span><span data-contrast="auto">After living</span><span data-contrast="auto"> on the outskirts of the city for a few years, </span><span data-contrast="auto">I know that the </span><span data-contrast="auto">difference this makes is </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">immeasurable</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">(</span><span data-contrast="auto">H</span><span data-contrast="auto">ave you ever tried to bus out of Charleswood after 10</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">pm? It’s nearly impossible.</span><span data-contrast="auto">)</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Since I’m already starting in a central location, wherever I need to go, I’m already halfway there!</span>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Why an Apartment is the Right Choice </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">f</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">or Me</span></b></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Like so many people, I’m all about convenience. I’m a busy person so anything that makes my life a little easier is a win. An apartment provides this in 4 way</span><span data-contrast="auto">s.</span>

https://livingat300main.ca/rent-vs-buy-which-is-right-for-you/

<b><span data-contrast="auto">1. All-in-one</span></b>
<span data-contrast="auto">My apartment building has everything I nee</span><span data-contrast="auto">d.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Fitness and laundry facilities on site means I save the cost of a gym membership fee and don’t need to regularly drag my things down to a laundromat.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span>

<b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Maintenance free</span></b>
<span data-contrast="auto">Buildings are a lot of maintenance!</span><b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">I appreciate that the apartment complex has a dedicated caretaker who keeps everything clean and running smoothly. Someone needs to cut the grass, water the flowers and make sure the electricity stays on. I’m glad these things are being taken care of and I’m equally glad I’m not the one who </span><span data-contrast="auto">has to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> do them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span>

<b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Neighbours</span></b>
<span data-contrast="auto">Your apartment building is like its own little community. Whether you’re the kind to stop and chat or not (I’m not) it’s nice other</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to know other</span><span data-contrast="auto"> people are close by (read: at a respectful distance).</span>

https://livingat300main.ca/wont-you-be-my-neighbour/

<b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Peace of mind</span></b>
<span data-contrast="auto">It’s a huge weight off of my shoulders to know that if something needs to be repaired</span><span data-contrast="auto">—whether </span><span data-contrast="auto">it’s a broken tap, an appliance on the fritz or something big like the hot water heater or the roof—</span><span data-contrast="auto">it will be taken care of. It’s comforting that the doors to the building are secure and that there are security cameras on site. Knowing that I have a safe and </span><span data-contrast="auto">functioning place to come back to makes apartment</span><span data-contrast="auto"> living nearly</span><i><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">stress</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">free.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">My apartment is the perfect combination of comfort and convenience</span><span data-contrast="auto">;</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">I can’t imagine a better place to live my life. If you’re looking for a low</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">stress, high</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">convenience option that gives you more time to focus on the people and things that you love, I advocate for an apartment. There are a lot of options in </span><span data-contrast="auto">all </span><span data-contrast="auto">different price ranges, so find something that suits your needs. And I’ll yell </span><span data-contrast="auto">it </span><span data-contrast="auto">from my </span><span data-contrast="auto">perfectly situated</span><span data-contrast="auto"> rooftop</span><span data-contrast="auto">: </span><span data-contrast="auto">there’s no better location than downtown!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>
