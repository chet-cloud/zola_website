By mixing many diverse cultures and knowing its audience, Winnipeg wins at the food game! Looking for the perfect place for an indulgent cheat day, a romantic date night, or delicious food with a side of live entertainment? These downtown spots have got you covered!
<h3><a href="http://peasantcookery.ca/">Peasant Cookery</a>: $$</h3>

283 Bannatyne Avenue

Housed in <a href="https://www.exchangedistrict.org/">the Exchange District</a>, Peasant Cookery is sometimes skimmed over when asked “Where should we grab a bite to eat at?” but it is definitely worth a gander. The menu has tons of options to try on your subsequent visits, so variety isn’t an issue. Everything is decently priced, with nothing on the menu costing more than $40. Peasant Cookery is a perfect date night spot or a place to get the girls together to enjoy a specialty cocktail. With Peasant Cookery, every bite shows you how much heart and soul go into each meal!

The service matches the atmosphere: high class. No matter how busy the restaurant, is the servers are always available and will graciously help you map out the best courses for your palate.

<em>My recommendation:</em> <strong><a href="http://peasantcookery.ca/menus/dinner/">Aged cheddar gnocchi</a> with the Sandman cocktail</strong>
<h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Fast-Food-Restaurant/Mitzis-Chicken-Finger-Restaurant-115673538494068/">Mitzi’s Chicken Finger Restaurant</a>: $</h3>
250 St. Mary Avenue

In the heart of downtown, Mitzi’s chicken finger restaurant offers Chinese and Canadian cuisine—turns out, chicken fingers are delicious with a side of rice. What makes Mitzi’s stand out is that every chicken finger is prepared fresh daily! The service is also is top-notch: the staff are friendly, and treat you like a guest, rather than a customer. It’s a great place to hit up before a Jets game or as a pit-stop on your way home from work.

<em>My recommendation:</em> <strong>Chicken fingers (obviously!) and a side of fried rice</strong>
<h3><a href="https://www.banhmikingwpg.com/">Banh Mi King</a>: $</h3>
510 Portage Ave

Banh Mi King is one of my personal favorite restaurants in downtown Winnipeg. Banh Mi King is conveniently located near the <a href="https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/">University of Winnipeg</a>. Everything on their menu is under $20 and offers real bang for your buck. No matter what you choose, you’ll leave satisfied and on the verge of a pleasant food coma. The service is unmatched, you will always be greeted with a warm welcome by whoever is at the cash register. They’re also happy to help you navigate through their extensive menu.

<em>My Recommendation:</em> <strong><a href="https://www.skipthedishes.com/banh-mi-king">Vegetarian Vietnamese sub</a></strong>
<h3><a href="https://acrosstheboardcafe.com/">Across the Board Game Café</a>: $</h3>
[caption id="attachment_3521" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BsnWJqsFzwX/"><img class="wp-image-3521" src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/by-katriz-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Across The Board Cafe, Winnipeg Restaurants, Downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments" width="450" height="450" /></a> Inside Across The Board Cafe ? by @katriz on Instagram[/caption]

211 Bannatyne Ave &amp; Main Street

Whether you’re a board game fanatic or just looking for a bite to eat with a side of entertainment, this café is a great choice. Housed in a cozy cafe a few blocks deep into <a href="https://www.exchangedistrict.org/">Exchange District</a>, Across the Board is the antithesis to digital culture. It’s the perfect space for spending quality time with close friends. They also offer an abundance of <a href="https://acrosstheboardcafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ATB_WeeklyLunchMenu_Feb01_2018.pdf">comfort food</a>, so you can share a bowl of popcorn with the people on your team, or dive into a warm, gooey bowl of mac &amp; cheese.

<em>My Recommendation:</em> <strong>Dill pickle popcorn or a taco pizza</strong>
<h3><a href="https://www.tipsycowwpg.com/">Tipsy Cow</a>: $</h3>
285 Portage Avenue

Tipsy Cow is a unique pub-style restaurant that offers <a href="https://www.tipsycowwpg.com/menu">gourmet burgers</a>, craft beer, poutine, and thick milkshakes. Situated near <a href="https://www.bellmtsplace.ca/">BellMTS Place</a>, Tipsy Cow is the perfect spot to grab a quick bite to eat before a concert or <a href="https://www.nhl.com/jets">Jets</a> game. It’s also a cozy date-night or gathering spot for you and close friends, thanks to the rich interior and excellent music.

The service is fast, friendly, and accommodating; Friday nights are usually busy, but the servers will make sure to make you still feel like a guest rather than just another table.

<em>My Recommendation:</em> <strong>The Winnipegger burger, onion rings, and a salted caramel milkshake</strong>
<h3><a href="http://www.deerandalmond.com/">Deer + Almond</a>: $$</h3>
85 Princess Street

The plates are designed for sharing with your friends or a date. The <a href="http://www.deerandalmond.com/menu">menu</a> is somewhat small, but you won’t care thanks to their unique selections! The quaint place offers a stand-out menu made full of creativity that will delight your taste buds.

You and your stomach will leave Deer + Almond satisfied and happy every time. The service is attentive but not overbearing, and if you are looking to spice things up you can ask the chef to choose your meal. You won’t be disappointed!

<em>My Recommendation:</em> <strong>Salt &amp; pepper squid</strong>
<h3><a href="https://www.zomato.com/winnipeg-mb/famenas-famous-roti-curry-downtown">Famena’s Famous Roti &amp; Curry</a>: $</h3>
295 Garry Street

[caption id="attachment_3528" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj4i2Oonbnp/"><img class="wp-image-3528" src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/by-colincorneau-1024x720.jpg" alt="Famena's Famous Roti &amp; Curry, Downtown Living, Winnipeg Downtown, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Living at 300" width="450" height="316" /></a> Owner &amp; cook of Famena's Famous Roti &amp; Curry ? by @colincorneau[/caption]

This restaurant lives up to its name: it’s the go-to Caribbean/West Indian cuisine in the city! Famena's is a small restaurant, nestled under a corkscrew parkade that you might just miss if you walk by too fast. What Famena’s lacks in space, they make up for with a rainbow of curries and an assortment of thick, fluffy roti. Everything is seasoned to perfection. If you’re feeling brave, try their deathly hot sauce (not for the faint of heart)!

Enjoy your meal with some light entertainment—provided by the hilarious banter of the couple/owners behind the counter! The owners of Famena’s add to the whole experience. Do yourself a favour and check this place out!

<em>My recommendation:</em> <strong>Curry shrimp or jerk chicken and vegetables</strong>
<h3><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g154954-d812642-Reviews-VJ_s_Drive_Inn-Winnipeg_Manitoba.html">VJ’s Drive-In</a>: $</h3>
170 Main Street

In a city with several newsworthy burger joints, VJ’s stands apart from the rest. VJ’s Drive-In has had an impeccable reputation in the downtown area for decades. You can buy a cheeseburger, side of fries and a milkshake for under $20, and the service you will receive when you enter through their door is priceless! VJ’s is a cash-only attraction, which quickens their

usually long lines. It’s a perfect summer’s night hang-out with picnic table seats and an old-fashioned atmosphere.

<em>My recommendation:</em> <strong>Fat Boy and a large vanilla shake</strong>

Winnipeg has so many delectable food joints that are just waiting for you to sink your teeth into! What are you waiting for? Let’s eat!
