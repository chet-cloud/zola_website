Have you ever been to a restaurant, bar or even hotel that just speaks to you? Maybe you’re drawn in by the menu, the decor, the service, or a beautiful combination of all three. Or maybe it has that certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.

<a href="https://smithrestaurant.ca/">Smith Restaurant</a> in the <a href="https://www.innforks.com/">Inn at the Forks</a> is one of those places.

Whether you’re enjoying a staycation, a family gathering, or looking for a more intimate <em>rendezvous</em> (yes, even for breakfast), Smith Restaurant should be at the top of your list.
<h3>The setting</h3>
Country chic. Comfortable. Warm and modern. In a nutshell, Smith’s interior is a blend of styles with something to appeal to everyone. And, given that Smith is a popular spot not only for breakfast but dinner and the after-dinner crowd as well, its appeal transcends the morning hours. Let’s call it <em>Canadiana</em> fusion, with wood features, modern lighting, leather and benches covered in <a href="https://www.thebay.com/">Hudson’s Bay</a> point blankets.

<h3>The service</h3>
Professional and yet personable fits the service to a tee. From the host, who was unfazed when we showed up early for our reservation, to our server Angela, with whom we shared a few good laughs. The service matched the situation and exceeded our expectations.
<h3>The menu</h3>
“Not your mama’s eggs” comes to mind when describing the menu. Not that there is anything wrong with her eggs, but Smith’s chefs have succeeded in creating a menu that features local, seasonal, and Canadian products, which really bumps those eggs up to the next level. Sure, you can order the Hotel Breakfast—which consists of some good old-fashioned eggs with a choice of bacon or sausage—or oatmeal (with a Saskatoon berry twist), but there are a few more interesting options.

My favourite of those interesting options is the Eggs Copenhagen. It might be the Scandinavian blood in me, but the Eggs Copenhagen called, and I was not disappointed. Two poached eggs with smoked lox and rösti potato came together nicely. Of course, no breakfast would be complete without a good cup of tea or coffee, and here, too, we pleasantly surprised.

In addition to the usual selection of teas, cappuccino, espresso, and Americano coffees, Smith offers a French press coffee option. We gave the French press a try, and it was exquisite.

If you’re looking to kick off your day with some good food, give Smith a try. Perhaps you, too, will find that it has that <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.

Feedback on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g154954-d7078344-Reviews-Smith_Restaurant-Winnipeg_Manitoba.html">TripAdvisor rates Smith a four out of five</a> with “value” having the lowest rating. This isn’t surprising, since restaurants in hotels are typically pricier.
