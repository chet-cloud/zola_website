With Valentine's day around the corner, it never hurts to plan a little something special for your darling. The typical breakfast in bed, dozen red roses and heart-shaped box of chocolates are all fine and dandy, but we can do better. This year, pump up the creativity, explore Winnipeg's downtown and surrounding areas, and leave your partner speechless!
<h3>1. <a href="https://manitobamuseum.ca/main/event/after-hours-wild-romance/">After Hours: Wild Romance</a></h3>
The <a href="https://manitobamuseum.ca/main/">Manitoba Museum</a> isn’t the first place that comes to mind when I think romance, but throw in some sensual Argentinian tango, a signature drink, and seriously <em>wild</em> activities, and voilà: a modern-day Valentine's celebration! Over the course of the evening, enjoy scavenger’s hunts, beer tastings with <a href="http://littlebrownjug.ca/">Little Brown Jug</a>, and pop-up talks. But these aren’t your average panel discussions; the talk themes are "all things horn-y" and "plants just wanna have sex." (Get your mind out of the gutter—the talks are about wildlife, not humans!)

This wild night is perfect for friends, couples, and singles looking for a new spin on a beloved night. It’ll be a night of unexpected fun, romance, and good bites with delicious drinks. The best part? It's a short walk away from <a href="https://300main.ca/">300 Main</a>!
<h3>2. Winnipeg's ultimate sports night</h3>
Looking for the ultimate Winnipeg experience? What is more Winnipeg than grabbing a beer or wine and great seats to a live hockey game? On cupids chosen day, you can score yourself tickets to the <a href="https://www1.ticketmaster.ca/winnipeg-jets-vs-colorado-avalanche-winnipeg-manitoba-02-14-2019/event/1100550D92A2396A?dma_id=530&amp;brand=nhl&amp;wt.mc_id=NHL_TEAM_WIN_WEB_MIG&amp;utm_source=NHL.com&amp;utm_medium=client&amp;utm_campaign=NHL_TEAM_WIN&amp;utm_content=WEB_MIG">Winnipeg Jets vs Colorado Avalanche</a>. If your partner is the ultimate Jets fan, give them a gift they’ll truly cherish by spending a memorable night screaming "GO JETS GO!” For some pre-game fun, think outside of the box: present your sweetie with Jets gear, stick-on tattoos and tickets to that night’s game. On your walk to <a href="https://www.bellmtsplace.ca/">BellMTS Place</a>, surprise your date with dinner at <a href="https://www.carbonecafeclub.com/">Carbone Cafe Club</a> (who’s up for recreating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nWNXO3CZkU">Lady and The Tramp’s pasta kiss</a>?), or grab some apps at <a href="https://moxies.com/restaurant-locations/manitoba/winnipeg-MTS-place">Moxie's</a>. Winnipeg's downtown is filled with restaurants to suit everyone's palate.

<h3>3. The Classic Valentine's day: Dinner &amp; a Movie at <a href="https://www.themetwinnipeg.com/">the Met</a></h3>
Is your partner the ultimate romantic that loves to be swept off their feet? The original 1942 black and white version of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/">Casablanca</a> will be showing at <a href="https://www.themetwinnipeg.com/">the Metropolitan Entertainment Center</a>. One of Winnipeg's national historic sites, originally built in 1919, the Met opened as a grand theatre to entertain the masses during cinema's height of film. The Met now boasts a 35-foot screen—so any seat in the house is a good one—and elegant furnishings. This is not your average movie date: pre-movie, you’ll be wined and dined with the Mets’ signature buffet; during the movie, you’ll enjoy hot-off-the-press buttery popcorn. Does your average <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=netflix%20and%20chill">Netflix and chill</a> session come with an intermission to delight your senses with coffee and dessert?<em> I don’t think so</em>. Create your own “We’ll always have Paris” moment and get carried away on all the romance in the air.
<h3>4. A little winter <em>amour</em></h3>
Living in Winnipeg, we’re lucky enough to have to picturesque winter backdrop that emanates that cozy, idealistic fairy-tale feeling. Valentine's Day is smack-dab in the middle of the best part of our winters, so some of the best outdoor activities are available—including ice skating at <a href="https://www.theforks.com/">The Forks</a>. <a href="https://www.theforks.com/events/red-river-mutual-trail">The Red River Mutual Trail</a> currently <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/guinness-gives-official-nod-to-winnipeg-skating-trail-1.740139">holds the Guinness record</a> for the longest naturally frozen skating trail in the world.

Share a piece of Winnipeg's history with your special someone and capture the moment with The Forks’ many selfie-worthy spots. Picture yourself holding your date's hand while floating down the trail under the stars, enjoying the <a href="https://www.warminghuts.com/">warming huts</a> brought to Winnipeg by architects from all over the world, hanging out under the magical lit walkway, and gliding across the historic rail bridge.

A little history + some fresh air + Winnipeg's beloved pass time = authentic Winnipeg romance. Don't end your evening on the trail: head over to <a href="https://www.theforks.com/attractions/the-forks-market-plaza">The Forks Market</a> for some <a href="https://www.theforks.com/eat-and-drink/dine">food and a drink</a> to wrap up the evening.
<h3>5. Sweet Tooth delight</h3>
If your date has a serious sweet tooth, why not gift them with a personalized tour of Winnipeg's sweet spots? You don't have to venture far to satisfy their every craving! Let's start our delightful date at <a href="http://constancepopp.com/">Chocolatier Constance Popp</a> with some chocolate marshmallow puffs. This no ordinary chocolate shop: Constance Popp displays each piece of decadent chocolate with beautiful artistry and creativity. Next, head over to <a href="https://www.chocoberrydesserthouse.com/">Chocoberry Dessert House</a> for something savoury; my recommendation is the Salted Caramel S'mores Dip.
