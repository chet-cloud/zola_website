<span data-contrast="auto">If you just moved into your </span><span data-contrast="auto">new apartment</span><span data-contrast="auto">, you may be</span><span data-contrast="auto"> hanging out in front of some very exposed windows</span><span data-contrast="auto"> right now.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (I </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">shutter</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> at the thought!) Or maybe you just </span><span data-contrast="auto">want </span><span data-contrast="auto">to change </span><span data-contrast="auto">up</span><span data-contrast="auto"> your window coverings</span><span data-contrast="auto">. If the answer to your drapery desires is shrouded in mystery, </span><span data-contrast="auto">here are a few questions to ask yourself </span><span data-contrast="auto">that will make choosing the right curtain or blind an open</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">and</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">shut case</span><span data-contrast="auto">!</span>
<h3>1. How should your space look and feel?</h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">This is the most important question. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Do you ache to recreate that romantic</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> sweeping curtain </span><span data-contrast="auto">look </span><span data-contrast="auto">you’ve been mooning over? Or are you obsessed with the sleek lines and natural feel of </span><a href="https://www.homedepot.ca/product/levolor-wood-blinds-2-inch/1000495453"><span data-contrast="none">wood</span><span data-contrast="none"> blinds</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">? Consider what kind of ambiance you want for your space</span><span data-contrast="auto">:</span><span data-contrast="auto"> c</span><span data-contrast="auto">urtains add a softer flow to your aesthetic, whereas blinds feel more modern.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6254" src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/woman-wearing-white-sweater-standing-in-front-of-window-3165350-2-819x1024.jpg" alt="Choosing the Curtains or Blinds for Your Space, , apartments winnipeg, winnipeg apartments, finding an apartment in winnipeg, apartment living, downtown living, apartment lifestyle, downtown winnipeg apartments, downtown lifestyle, downtown living, living in downtown winnipeg, living in downtown winnipeg apartments" width="819" height="1024" />

<span data-contrast="auto">The thing about curtains is that they’re completely customizable. You can choose how heavy the fabric is, how long they are, the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/H-Versailtex-Primitive-Darkening-Insulated-inch-Teal/dp/B075L3N64H/ref=sxin_4_ac_d_rm?ac_md=1-1-Y3VydGFpbnMgbGl2aW5nIHJvb20%3D-ac_d_rm&amp;cv_ct_cx=curtains&amp;keywords=curtains&amp;pd_rd_i=B075L3N64H&amp;pd_rd_r=def65881-d6ab-456e-b982-3e108cb22c1a&amp;pd_rd_w=xWdM5&amp;pd_rd_wg=VcPyO&amp;pf_rd_p=395c052b-36dd-4294-bb8c-6973256a7681&amp;pf_rd_r=4Q3GJJ4E2CXC43HMV514&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1581553397&amp;sr=1-2-12d4272d-8adb-4121-8624-135149aa9081"><span data-contrast="none">colour</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, texture, whatever you</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">dream</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of </span><span data-contrast="auto">(provided the fabric actually exists somewhere).</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">You still have many choices with blinds, but they’re mostly made of wood or plastic slats that run vertically or horizontally. There are also the </span><a href="https://www.homedepot.ca/product/levolor-decorative-roller-shades/1000113182"><span data-contrast="none">pull-down roller types</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or roman blinds if you want to use </span><span data-contrast="auto">that fabric you have your eye on, but you might need to get them custom made.</span>
<h3>2. How much work are you willing to put into installing them?</h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Blinds contain mechanisms for opening and closing, making them immediately more com</span><span data-contrast="auto">plicated. Keep in mind that you’re either going to be mounting them to the inside of the window frame or the wall itself! This means </span><span data-contrast="auto">you’ll </span><span data-contrast="auto">need to drill directly into something, and be precise with your measurements </span><span data-contrast="auto">for </span><span data-contrast="auto">inset blinds.</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you’re co</span><span data-contrast="auto">ncerned about damaging the walls, </span><span data-contrast="auto">heavy-duty </span><a href="https://www.walmart.ca/en/command/N-1020336"><span data-contrast="none">Command hooks</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> are usually capable of supporting a </span><span data-contrast="auto">curtain rod </span><span data-contrast="auto">(as long as you’re not hanging those weighty antique velvet drapes). Plus, you’re </span><span data-contrast="auto">dealing with just the one rod, so it’s not as complex.</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Here’s a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">neat trick I came across</span><span data-contrast="auto">: W</span><span data-contrast="auto">hen you’re marking the spots for the support mounts, if you position an L-shaped piece of cardboard against the window frame and push a pencil through, you can flip it around to mark the opposite mounting point evenly. (So simpl</span><span data-contrast="auto">e, yet so genius. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Thanks, Youtube!)</span>
<h3>3. How frequently are you going to clean them?</h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Now this one, you need to </span><span data-contrast="auto">be</span><span data-contrast="auto"> honest about. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Nobody stays on top of their cleaning as much as they’d like to. (Or maybe you do. Don’t judge me!)  Really though, how often will</span><span data-contrast="auto"> you </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">actually</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> bother looking at how dusty your blinds are?</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you want to keep blinds clean, you need to wipe them down once a week or so. If that sounds like something you can handle, go for it. Curtains can usually</span><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">*</span></i></b><span data-contrast="auto"> just go in the washer every few month</span><span data-contrast="auto">s, depending on what they’re made of.</span>

<i><span data-contrast="auto">*</span></i><i><span data-contrast="auto">Please guys, for the sake of textile integrity, if your curtains come with washing instructions</span></i><i><span data-contrast="auto"> – read </span></i><i><span data-contrast="auto">them and do what they say!</span></i>

<span data-contrast="auto">Now what about everyday quality of life stuff? Like…</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6256" src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/eduard-militaru-Q4PvX80itZ0-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="Choosing the Curtains or Blinds for Your Space, , apartments winnipeg, winnipeg apartments, finding an apartment in winnipeg, apartment living, downtown living, apartment lifestyle, downtown winnipeg apartments, downtown lifestyle, downtown living, living in downtown winnipeg, living in downtown winnipeg apartments" width="1024" height="683" />
<h3>4. How often do you want to open and close these things?</h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Are you going to get up each morning and with a cup of coffee in hand</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><span data-contrast="auto">throw </span><span data-contrast="auto">the curtains </span><span data-contrast="auto">wide </span><span data-contrast="auto">open </span><span data-contrast="auto">to soak in the day? Or do you work nights</span><span data-contrast="auto">, with a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> sleep cycle </span><span data-contrast="auto">that </span><span data-contrast="auto">demands </span><span data-contrast="auto">you block out every </span><span data-contrast="auto">vile </span><span data-contrast="auto">ray of </span><span data-contrast="auto">sunlight?</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Curtains are g</span><span data-contrast="auto">enerally better for </span><a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/majgull-blackout-curtains-1-pair-dark-blue-70341034/"><span data-contrast="none">blocking out more light</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Still, as far as light levels go, they’re kind of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">all</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">or</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">nothing. And unless you’ve got something like a fancy electric track rigged up, you have to physically open and close them.</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you ain’t got time</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for that, blinds have a string you can pull, or a knob you can twist to do the job for you more quickly. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Maximum efficiency!</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Plus! With slatted blinds you can adjust how much or how little light to let in. Not to </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">throw shade</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> at</span><span data-contrast="auto"> curtains</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> but this i</span><span data-contrast="auto">s the feature I find the most </span><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">val</span></i></b><i><span data-contrast="auto">-ance-</span></i><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">uable</span></i></b><span data-contrast="auto"> (okay, no more puns). In exchange for this flexibility</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> though, you can’t ever block out </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">all </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">the light</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> because that’s how slats work.</span>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">So what do you choose?</span></b></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Personally, I love the easy elegance of a curtain an</span><span data-contrast="auto">d ensuring no light is getting anywhere near me on</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Saturday morning. But</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">what</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">make-or-break for me</span><span data-contrast="auto"> doesn’t necessarily matter to you. Think about what is important to you and remember the main points:</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">As someone who likes to get the best of both wo</span><span data-contrast="auto">rlds, my ideal set</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">up is an inset blind with a curtain draped over top. That’s more elaborate though, so go with whatever makes the most sense for you.</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Whatever you choose, if you do nothing else, </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">measure your windows before you start</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">!</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you’re at the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> store and tell someone you need a covering for a “standard sized window</span><span data-contrast="auto">,”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> I can tell you from experience the staff will be frustrated and probably laugh at the absurdity of the question after you leave. Or</span><span data-contrast="auto"> you could end up buying the wrong size and havin</span><span data-contrast="auto">g to be annoyed about it later. Remember: </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">be a treasure, just measure</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">That’s </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">curtains</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> for me! (I couldn’t resist!)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span>
