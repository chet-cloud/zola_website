The holidays are just around the corner, and while some always seem to be ahead of the game and finish their Christmas shopping by the time Black Friday hits, others (like me) wait until the last minute. By then, the malls are flooded with well-intentioned but anxious people looking to nab some last-minute gifts. The entire experience becomes frenzied, and the joy of picking out gifts for your loved ones’ withers.

And then comes the second wave of anxiety—what do you get for your friends and family members, who are all very different from each other? What can you get them that will leave a lasting impression? If you’re like me, you pride yourself on giving thoughtful, unique gifts, making downtown the best place to find all your gifts this holiday season! Forget the headache of navigating mall parking lots and the throngs of people inside. Winnipeg’s downtown area has amazing shops, every one of them specialised in merchandise you can’t find at the mall.
