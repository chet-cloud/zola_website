Winnipeg’s craft beer scene continues to evolve, with taprooms spread around the city. There are so many options that <a href="https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/">Tourism Winnipeg</a> has created a handy tool to help you <a href="https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/eat-and-drink/breweries">choose a brewery</a>!

To tempt your palate, here are a few taprooms to consider:
<h3><a href="https://www.nonsuch.beer/nonsuch">Nonsuch Brewing Co.</a></h3>
<a href="https://www.nonsuch.beer/nonsuch">Nonsuch Brewing Co.</a> is a recent addition to the Winnipeg craft beer scene, having opened in October 2018. Located in the heart of the <a href="https://www.exchangedistrict.org/">Exchange District</a>, this relaxed <em>brasserie</em> offers patrons a choice of seven different beers on tap. Choices range from a Belgian Blonde, <a href="https://www.nonsuch.beer/on-tap">described</a> as a golden-coloured ale with light grain aromas, to La Molière, a pilsner designed in collaboration with Winnipeg’s own <a href="https://www.cerclemoliere.com/en/">Théâtre Cercle Molière</a>.

To help you enjoy your brew, limited snacks are available for purchase. You’re also invited to bring in your own food or place an order through <a href="https://www.skipthedishes.com/">Skip The Dishes</a>.

125 Pacific Avenue
Tuesday to Saturday, 4 to 11 pm
<h3><a href="https://stoneangelbrewing.com/">Stone Angel Brewing Co.</a></h3>
If hints of cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger are more to your liking, then <a href="https://stoneangelbrewing.com/beers/nollaig/">Nollaig</a> might just be up your alley. This winter ale is a creation of <a href="https://stoneangelbrewing.com/">Stone Angel Brewing Co.</a>, which joined the Winnipeg scene in 2017. Nollaig is just one of the 12 choices <a href="https://stoneangelbrewing.com/beerage/ontap/">currently on tap</a>.

<img class="size-large wp-image-3655 aligncenter" src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Stone-Angel-Brewing-1024x749.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="749" />

And for the adventurous, a small amount of an experimental beer is released every Saturday. They also have a generous happy hour all day Sunday, and from Wednesday to Saturday from 4:30 to 6:30. Stop by, and consider posing for a selfie with the mascot in the taproom. (With a name like that, how could they resist?)

Stone Angel Brewing shares its space with two other promising breweries—<a href="http://devilmaycarebrewing.com/">Devil May Care</a> and <a href="https://kilterbrewing.co/">Kilter</a>. A selection from each is also available on tap.

1875 Pembina Highway, Unit 9
Wednesday and Thursday, 3:30 to 10 pm
Friday, 12 to 11 pm
Saturday, 12 to 11 pm
Sunday, 2 to 6 pm
<h3><a href="http://littlebrownjug.ca/">Little Brown Jug</a></h3>
Located in what was originally the livery stable for city hall, <a href="http://littlebrownjug.ca/">Little Brown Jug</a> has become a popular spot on the edge of the <a href="https://www.exchangedistrict.org/">Exchange District</a>. Those interested in the brewing process can sit back, enjoy a drink and watch the brew masters at work in the open-concept space.

<img class="size-large wp-image-3656 aligncenter" src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_7404-1024x683.jpg" alt="Little Brown Jug, Craft Beer, Exchange District, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments" width="1024" height="683" />

Little Brown Jug’s signature ale is the <a href="http://littlebrownjug.ca/beer/">1919</a> Belgian pale ale, which is brewed using the German double-fermentation technique. Kegs are available for rent (or bring your own) and growlers can be refilled.

Snacks are available, and you’re welcome to order in food.

Here’s a bit of trivia for you—“1919” is named in homage to Winnipeg’s famous general strike of 1919.

Tuesday to Thursday, 12 to 9 pm
Friday and Saturday, 12 to 11 pm
Sunday, 12 to 5 pm
