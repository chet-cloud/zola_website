<p>Our mood and energy levels can be impacted greatly by how our environment smells. If your living space smells great, don’t be surprised if you catch yourself in a better mood, feel more positive about life, and be more focused on what you need to get done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;After all, who doesn’t love a great-smelling home? So don’t knock it till you try it!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you like trying new things and want to improve the quality of your life, make this spring all about experimenting with different ways to make your home smell amazing. And there are quite a few ways so you can pick and choose depending on your taste and budget.</p>

<p>My personal favorite is the diffuser. So subtle and yet so powerful. And honestly, there is something so calming about looking at all the mist that flows out. I often catch myself just staring at it.  You can choose whatever combination of essential oils you like, or you can swap them around depending on your mood and time of day. Something is calming like peppermint for a meditation or yoga session and maybe some lavender for when you want to curl up on the sofa with a cup of green tea. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feel free to try out different scents till you find ‘the one.’ You can also choose to put smaller diffusers around the apartment and in the bathrooms when you’re having guests over. Everyone loves to be greeted with a fresh scent, whether they are entering the main door or the bathroom.</p>

<p>The benefits of aromatherapy are numerous. It can help you relax, improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety—all great things in today’s stressful and fast lifestyle. After a tiring day, you would want to come back to your little haven. And let’s be honest, no one likes a stinky haven. And the good news is, there is no one right way to make your home smell good. There are so many options out there that you’re bound to find one that suits your needs and lifestyle. You just have to take the first step to find out what works best for you.</p>

<p>Scented candles are another way to make your living space smell heavenly, especially if you’re the kind of person who likes warm tones. You can try out vanilla if you want to go subtle, cinnamon for a spicier feel, and flowery scents if you really want to feel like spring is in the air or in your living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Candles also really add some personality to a living room. They come in different sizes and styles, so you can choose a minimalistic version that is not too conspicuous or go for something fancy if you really want people to notice the source of the heavenly scent that will be coming from your home this spring!</p>

<p>Burning incense can also be an interesting way to freshen up the scent in your home. It can help to reduce anxiety and would go well with a meditation session. The scented smoke would work well for a spiritual purpose, but if you are sensitive to inhaling smoke, then this might not be the best option for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re a DIY kind of person and like to keep things basic, just throw in some orange and lemon slices with cinnamon sticks in a pot of water and let it boil. Your kitchen will smell of citrusy and cinnamon goodness in no time! Or better yet, bake a batch of cookies if you really want some authentic vanilla and cinnamon scent in the kitchen and also have something to munch on while you enjoy the yummy smell!</p>

<p>If candles and diffusers are too much for you and you are looking for a more subtle way to improve the way your home smells, then reed diffusers might be your best bet. They look classy, the fragrance isn’t too strong, and there are a lot of options to choose from! Also, if you like being safe, there are no flames or electric plug-ins involved, so you don’t have to worry about switching it off or blowing it.</p>

<p>Another great way to really get creative and enjoy a great smelling room is to make your own room spray! How cool is that! It’s definitely on my list for this spring! You can control how strong you want the scent to be, what your favorite blend might be, and just imagine the possibilities! Once you come up with a winning combination, you can make cute little spray bottles and pass them on to family and friends so they, too, can feel like spring really is in the air. Of their own homes!</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Spring towards a brand-new scent. And a brand new you!</p>
