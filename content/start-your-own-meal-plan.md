<p>“What’s for dinner?” is that incessant question that never seems to go away, kind of like those piles of dishes and laundry that keep reappearing. Plus, we’ve got breakfast and lunch to contend with as well, now that we’re spending more time at home than ever.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While there are still plenty of takeout and delivery options in Winnipeg, home cooking is less expensive and - usually - a healthier choice (plus, the less contact with other people the better!). But&nbsp;<em>what are you making??</em>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Preparing for three meals a day, seven days a week - plus snacks! Don’t forget the snacks! -&nbsp; can be pretty daunting, but meal planning isn’t about picking out 12 new recipes you’ve never tried before and forcing them into your week. It’s about forming your food schedule around your lifestyle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might think that meal planning is only for busy soccer moms, but regardless of whether you’ve got a family at home or it’s just you and your<em>&nbsp;tchotchkes</em>, a little prep can save you time, money, and more importantly, the anguish of having to choose what’s for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I do a lot of cooking to support my eating habit and I’ve picked up a few strategies over the years. Here are my tips for creating a manageable meal plan:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6623,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/First-picC-1024x683.jpg" alt="Woman cooking dinner" class="wp-image-6623"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1 - <strong>Plan around your schedule.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you’re thinking about meals for the upcoming week, consider what else you’ve got going on and how they will affect your time and energy for food prep.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Slotting in a crock-pot recipe if you’ll be at the (home) gym late, or you’re planning that Zoom cocktail get-together with your friends, lets you quickly throw together a completed meal.&nbsp;Or, when the whole evening is wide open, that’s the perfect opportunity for something more elaborate you’ve been wanting to try!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing to keep in mind (as if we could forget) - Mondays are hard. Whatever day your Monday actually is, plan for something delicious and relatively easy (think pasta night with salad for lunch). A quick win at the beginning of your week starts you off on the right foot and makes the rest of the week seem easier!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6625,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Basic ingredients" class="wp-image-6625"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2 - <strong>Consider what’s in your refrigerator.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If those bell peppers are on their last legs or your milk is about to expire, pick recipes that will use them up!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Try writing a master ingredient list for everything you want to make in the coming week. Before you go to the store, go through your fridge, freezer, cupboards, secret food stash in the ceiling and mark off all the things you already have - Ta-da! Whatever is left is your grocery list!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3 - <strong>Build your basics.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A well-stocked pantry is the key to successful home cooking. These are your building blocks for many recipes and are enough on their own to throw together a Plan B meal in a pinch. At minimum, I’m talking about:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Salt &amp; pepper&nbsp;</li><li>Olive oil&nbsp;</li><li>Soup stock (chicken or veggie are the most versatile),&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Rice&nbsp;</li><li>Pasta&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Your&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;vinegar&nbsp; (mine is balsamic but if you’re only going to pick one, white wine vinegar is my recommendation&nbsp; - it’s mild, gives the acidity you want and gives a little wine-y&nbsp;flavor&nbsp;to your recipes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>And don’t forget a sweetener - honey, agave or even maple syrup!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other good things to keep around are: garlic, ginger, onions, beans (canned for spontaneous beans or dried if you’re really planning ahead), canned tomatoes and some canned soups. There are so many things you can do with a can of mushroom soup! I’ll share my recipe for mushroom “Alfredo” sauce below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you get an idea of what your go-to recipes take, you’ll know what else you want to keep on hand. You probably want a selection of your&nbsp;cherished&nbsp;condiments and sauces - ever since I discovered <em>Hoisin</em> sauce, there is never not some in my fridge!&nbsp;And it never hurts to keep an emergency box of KD around,&nbsp;<em>just&nbsp;</em>in case!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-1024x820.jpg" alt="Food portioned to be frozen" class="wp-image-6626"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4 - <strong>Anticipate leftovers.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I love leftovers! Not only do I get more of the delicious things I already made, but I also get to skip cooking something else. If I make up a big batch of meatballs, that’s three or four meals worth of protein that I can either eat with leftover rice, throw in with other ingredients, or if I don’t want to eat the same thing all week, freeze for later.&nbsp; Which reminds me of...&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5 - <strong>Batch cook meals to freeze (so when you don’t want to cook, you don’t have to!).&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While you’re cooking up big meals, why not go the extra kilometer and make some things that are freezer friendly? This can be leftovers (if your recipe freezes well), a batch of freezer burritos (don’t worry, I’ve got a recipe for you) or breakfast muffins (regular muffins, or egg “muffins”, or even donut muffins. I couldn’t choose my&nbsp;favorite, but there are many recipes online).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best part - if you spend a little time creating these freezer meals, you have several options to grab, nuke, and go for those days when you don’t have the time or energy to get in the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6627,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1024x684.jpg" alt="Man holding plate of tacos" class="wp-image-6627"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6 - <strong>Try a Theme Day!&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For an easy jumping off point in your meal planning, slot in a Theme Day (the term for this is actually Meal Templates, but that is not as fun as a Theme Day).&nbsp;We always think of Taco Tuesday, but you could do Mexican Monday or Curry Thursday. Your Theme can be whatever you like - it doesn’t even have to start with the same letter as the day! Pick a couple of categories you like and plan on them once a week. Fun!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This kind of focal point is helpful when you’re meal planning. You’re basically narrowing down the field from&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>the recipes to a specific category of recipes to choose from. If you know that you’re having pasta on Friday you only need to decide whether you’re making that decadent carbonara or a lasagna that could feed you through the weekend (or freezes really well).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7- <strong>Rely on your tried-and-true recipes.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all have our go-to meals, the ones we keep coming back to again and again. Well, they’re&nbsp;popular&nbsp;for a reason! It’s not necessary to get a roster of brand-new recipes every week. On nights when you’re busy with other things or you just want something easy or familiar, rely on those recipes that you know will not fail you.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My current easy, throw-together meal is a cucumber and tomato salad (and yes, you can have this recipe too). It’s super versatile and as simple as chopping up some veg, throwing that into a bowl and eating!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8 - <strong>Try new things.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the internet, we no longer need to rely on our mothers’ hand-me-down cookbook for recipes (though do keep that close by). It’s easy to search for a recipe for almost anything and find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are even websites where you plug in the ingredients you want to use, and it will return a list of options for you! (Reverse lookup for recipes? Yes, please!). Personally, I’m a big fan of All Recipes where people share their own recipes and others can review them. You can see pictures, read about how it turned out, and what you might want to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One sneaky little trick (a&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;of my mother’s) is to regularly patrol the send-you-meal-ingredients-in-a-box service websites. There is often a cache of recipes that rotates with what they’re currently offering. You can snag those tasty recipes and then buy your own ingredients.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6628,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/9Prep-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chopped vegetables on the board" class="wp-image-6628"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9 - <strong>Prep ingredients in advance.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The advantage of knowing what you’ll be making is figuring out what ingredients you need ahead of time. This makes it easy to chop up a bunch of vegetables whenever you have a spare 10 minutes, and have them ready to go. If you can’t imagine where you’d get a spare 10 minutes, set aside a dedicated half hour at some point in the week instead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If all your onions, peppers and garlic are already chopped, you can throw them straight into the pan without worrying about the prep work. Trust me, you’ll thank your past self for your forethought.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>So...</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meal planning seems like a lot of work. And don’t get me wrong, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;still work. But the amount of time you put into it easily pays itself back and then some when you no longer need to waffle (mmm… waffles) over what you are going to make for breakfast, lunch and dinner each and every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cooking is creative - have fun with it! I like to use versatile recipes that can be catered to my own tastes. Don’t be afraid to experiment - adjust the seasonings to your preference. If you hate bell peppers but love carrots, swap them out. Not all your experiments will turn out to be amazing, but some of them will.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve got a few recipes to get you started. These are my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;versions of these recipes, and I can tell you that&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;love them, but make your own adjustments as you see fit. Have fun!&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Mushroom “Alfredo” -&nbsp; 4 servings</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not exactly traditional, but tasty and with less fat than a true Alfredo&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>2 teaspoons olive oil&nbsp;</li><li>1 small yellow onion, chopped&nbsp;</li><li>2-3 cloves of garlic, chopped (this is being conservative, but you measure garlic with your heart)&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)&nbsp;</li><li>1 can of condensed mushroom soup&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup (about 1 soup can full) half &amp; half cream&nbsp;</li><li>½ cup grated parmesan cheese&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Fettuccine noodles&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Parsley&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Directions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a non-stick skillet. Add chopped onions to heated pan and sauté until starting to soften.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Put on a pot of water to boil for your pasta. You want the sauce to be complete before the pasta is cooked, but they should be done about the same time. Cook the pasta to package directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Add garlic and mushrooms (if using) and cook until onions are clear, and mushrooms have shrunk down. If your mushrooms are too dry, add a bit more olive oil.&nbsp;</li><li>Open the can of condensed mushroom soup into the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Slowly start to add the cream, a couple of tablespoons at a time, stirring it completely into the soup mixture before adding more. This should end with a smooth,&nbsp;liquid&nbsp;sauce&nbsp;</li><li>Add parmesan cheese and stir in completely. It should still be thin enough to run off a spoon but to coat the back of it. If the sauce is too thick, add more cream. If it is too&nbsp;liquid, add more cheese.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Let simmer over low heat until pasta is cooked. Drain pasta and toss in the sauce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Serve and garnish with parsley!&nbsp;</li></ul>

If you want them slightly chewier, reduce heat to 225°F</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h4>Tomato Cucumber Salad - Fast and Easy - 1 serving&nbsp;(Lettuce is overrated!)</h4>

Repeat until all filling is used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Place in heated oven for 20 minutes. Let cool then wrap each burrito in tinfoil. Store in large&nbsp;ziploc&nbsp;or container in your freezer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>To reheat, remove tinfoil and microwave for 3-5 minutes&nbsp;</li></ul>
