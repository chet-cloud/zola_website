excerpt: |-
  I love garden centres. I always manage to discover something new and fresh – no pun intended!  They’re alive with greenery and full of rich colours. Most of all, they’re filled with ideas about how to bring a space to life, be it indoors or outdoors.

  If you live in a studio apartment, creating different areas for living, working and sleeping can be key to making your home work for you. Greenery can be a great way to create separation between different living areas without making your space feel smaller or cramped.

G</span><span data-contrast="none">reenery can be a great way to</span><span data-contrast="none"> create separation between different living areas</span><span data-contrast="none"> without making your space feel smaller or cramped. </span><span data-contrast="none">H</span><span data-contrast="none">ere are </span><span data-contrast="none">three ways </span><span data-contrast="none">to do just that</span><span data-contrast="none">:</span>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Add a Potted Plant or Two</span></b></h3>
<span data-contrast="none">The simplest and least</span><span data-contrast="none"> expensive</span><span data-contrast="none"> option is to </span><span data-contrast="none">purchase</span><span data-contrast="none"> a plant or two</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">plus </span><span data-contrast="none">pots </span><span data-contrast="none">that </span><span data-contrast="none">match your style. </span><span data-contrast="none">Choosing a plant</span><span data-contrast="none"> isn’t just about what looks prettiest</span><span data-contrast="none">; p</span><span data-contrast="none">lants have needs</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">too, </span><span data-contrast="none">and you want to make the right choice</span><span data-contrast="none"> for both of you</span><span data-contrast="none">. </span><span data-contrast="none">This </span><span data-contrast="none">may mean doing some </span><a href="https://www.shelmerdine.com/plant-care/"><span data-contrast="none">research on plant care</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> before </span><span data-contrast="none">making a purchase</span><span data-contrast="none">, getting </span><span data-contrast="none">professional advice in the garden </span><span data-contrast="none">centre</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> or at a minimum, </span><span data-contrast="none">reading </span><span data-contrast="none">the instruction card that </span><span data-contrast="none">usually comes with the plant.</span>

<span data-contrast="none">If space is at a premium, avoid plants that spread out too much. You don’t want to be brushing up against them </span><span data-contrast="none">when you walk past, </span><span data-contrast="none">as </span><span data-contrast="none">this </span><span data-contrast="none">may damage them. </span><span data-contrast="none">At</span><span data-contrast="none"> the opposite end of the spectrum, </span><span data-contrast="none">opting for small </span><a href="https://www.gemsplantdesign.com/product-page/echeveria-mensah"><span data-contrast="none">succulents</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">may save you and </span><span data-contrast="none">your wardrobe from </span><span data-contrast="none">the s</span><span data-contrast="none">cratches and</span><span data-contrast="none"> snags</span><span data-contrast="none"> that can happen when you brush against a plant</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span>

<a href="https://www.gemsplantdesign.com/product-page/snake-plant-fernwood-2-5-ft-tall"><span data-contrast="none">Tall plants</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> or </span><a href="https://www.gemsplantdesign.com/product-page/ficus-fiddle-leaf-3ft-tall"><span data-contrast="none">trees</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> can be used to create different areas in your living space, they can also add an interesting new element to draw the eye. </span><span data-contrast="none">Take advantage of </span><span data-contrast="none">beautiful tall plants</span><span data-contrast="none"> to </span><span data-contrast="none">bring an</span><span data-contrast="none"> additional</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">dimension </span><span data-contrast="none">to</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">your</span><span data-contrast="none"> room.</span>

<span data-contrast="none">How much light does the room get? Are you north or south facing? Is the light direct/indirect?</span><span data-contrast="none"> Different plants will have very different light needs. </span><span data-contrast="none">A little planning can save you from the sad sight of drooping leaves.</span>

<span data-contrast="none">And </span><span data-contrast="none">finally</span><span data-contrast="none">, how much care do they need? If you enjoy</span><span data-contrast="none"> travelling frequently</span><span data-contrast="none">, you </span><span data-contrast="none">may </span><span data-contrast="none">need to have someone water them in your absence or opt for </span><a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/cat/artificial-plants-flowers-20492/"><span data-contrast="none">artificial plants</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> instead. </span><span data-contrast="none">E</span><span data-contrast="none">ven if you</span><span data-contrast="none">’re not a frequent flyer</span><span data-contrast="none">, artificial plants </span><span data-contrast="none">can be a beautiful option. With </span><a href="https://www.structube.com/en/decor/artificial-flowers/page/2"><span data-contrast="none">faux greenery</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, what </span><span data-contrast="none">you buy is what you get</span><span data-contrast="none">: no need to worry about </span><span data-contrast="none">plant care</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">DIY </span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">Your Own </span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">Planters</span></b></h3>
<span data-contrast="none">If you’re a </span><span data-contrast="none">creative soul, consider making your own planters</span><span data-contrast="none">!</span><span data-contrast="none"> You can find inspiration everywhere</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> from local businesse</span><span data-contrast="none">s</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">to Pinterest</span><span data-contrast="none">, </span><span data-contrast="none">Instagram</span><span data-contrast="none">, </span><span data-contrast="none">HGTV and Canadian Living. Closer to home, </span><span data-contrast="none">visit your </span><span data-contrast="none">local garden </span><span data-contrast="none">centre</span><span data-contrast="none">; you’ll </span><span data-contrast="none">undoubtedly find a professional to chat with in person.</span><span data-contrast="none"> By DIYing, you can create the perfect planter for your space. Whether you need something large that will sit on the floor or something small for a table, DIY is as customizable as it gets.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6238" src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bernard-hermant-dclPEtMVdK8-unsplash-2-684x1024.jpg" alt="plants, indoor plants, house plants, apartment living, winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, downtown living in winnipeg, winnipeg downtown living, downtown lifestyle, diy planter, planter pot" width="684" height="1024" />

<span data-contrast="none">To help narrow down your options</span><span data-contrast="none">, decide </span><span data-contrast="none">whether you want to use real or artificial plants and establish a budget. Are you working with a tight one</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> or </span><span data-contrast="none">is </span><span data-contrast="none">the sky</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">the limit?</span>

<span data-contrast="none">Now that you know what you want, </span><span data-contrast="none">it’s time to bring it </span><span data-contrast="none">together</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-contrast="none"> If you have the resources and</span><span data-contrast="none"> the know-how, g</span><span data-contrast="none">et started and have fun</span><span data-contrast="none">!</span><span data-contrast="none"> If, however, you</span><span data-contrast="none">’re </span><span data-contrast="none">like me</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">and not</span><span data-contrast="none">-</span><span data-contrast="none">so</span><span data-contrast="none">-</span><span data-contrast="none">gifted, consider taking a course. Many garden </span><span data-contrast="none">centre</span><span data-contrast="none">s</span><span data-contrast="none"> offer workshops on how to make your own planter. </span><span data-contrast="none">By taking a class, </span><span data-contrast="none">you</span><span data-contrast="none">’ll avoid ending up with leftover materials you don’t </span><span data-contrast="none">need,</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">and</span><span data-contrast="none"> you’ll</span><span data-contrast="none"> learn </span><span data-contrast="none">a new skill.</span>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Add A Living Screen</span></b></h3>
<span data-contrast="none">The absolute simplest way to divide a room is to add a </span><a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/risoer-room-divider-white-black-70182191/"><span data-contrast="none">screen</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. </span><span data-contrast="none">They come in a variety of different materials</span><span data-contrast="none">, </span><span data-contrast="none">from bamboo and wicker</span><span data-contrast="none"> to</span><span data-contrast="none"> metal, wood, </span><span data-contrast="none">and </span><span data-contrast="none">plasti</span><span data-contrast="none">c</span><span data-contrast="none">. You can choose </span><span data-contrast="none">a screen </span><span data-contrast="none">based on size and colour</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> and </span><span data-contrast="none">they’re easy to change up </span><span data-contrast="none">when you decide</span><span data-contrast="none"> to redecorate</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span>

<span data-contrast="none">But for truly next-level décor, consider a living screen. Living screens </span><span data-contrast="none">are often used outdoors instead of fencing</span><span data-contrast="none"> or to create</span><span data-contrast="none"> a sense of privacy</span><span data-contrast="none">. Indoors,</span><span data-contrast="none"> they add chic greenery as well as privacy</span><span data-contrast="none">, and can still be built using outdoor supplies. You may need to use different plants indoors than you’d generally use outdoors, though—outdoor plants </span><span data-contrast="none">don’t always do so well when brought in</span><span data-contrast="none">side</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span>

<span data-contrast="none">To keep it simple, </span><span data-contrast="none">buy </span><span data-contrast="none">a shelving unit and simply fill it with </span><a href="https://www.verdeywg.shop/shop/tropical-plants/2"><span data-contrast="none">potted plants</span><span data-contrast="none"> of various shapes and sizes;</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> maybe even </span><span data-contrast="none">a </span><a href="https://www.verdeywg.shop/product/philodendron-brazil/353?cp=true&amp;sa=false&amp;sbp=false&amp;q=false&amp;category_id=2"><span data-contrast="none">vine</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> or two that will hang down. </span><span data-contrast="none">You can turn a simple shelf into</span><span data-contrast="none"> a unique living screen</span><span data-contrast="none"> that </span><span data-contrast="none">will differ from side to side, depending on how the plants grow.</span>

<span data-contrast="none">In the </span><span data-contrast="none">words of composer </span><span data-contrast="none">Richard Wagner</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> “Imagination creates reality.” </span><span data-contrast="none">A small </span><span data-contrast="none">or open space is an opportunity to flex your creative muscle and make your home truly unique. </span><span data-contrast="none">But if you find yours</span><span data-contrast="none">elf</span><span data-contrast="none"> needing a little </span><span data-contrast="none">help, there’s always your local garden </span><span data-contrast="none">centre</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span>
