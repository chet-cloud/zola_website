<p>Here are 5 Fun Things to do in Downtown Winnipeg This Season!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><li>True North Square</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>True North Square is still new to many people are wondering, what is there to do there? Well, there is lots to do at True North Square, any day of the week! From hosting the weekly farmers market, outdoor concerts, an impressive restaurant, and bar selection, you're going to find yourself going back more than a few times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside the exciting new towers of 242 Hargrave street, there is lots are waiting for you! Located inside is not only an impressive market at Mottola grocery, food court, lounges, and much more. When you go upstairs you are greeted into a beautiful common area with many great dine-in or take-out options for your inner foodie, it is anything but your every-day market and food court. Inside Mottola Grocery, there is a fantastic bakery, deli, a vast selection of fresh and unique ingredients, take-home food, and an impressive floral selection. They have a stunning selection of plants, succulents, cacti, flowers, floral arrangements, and decor.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you happen to love what you ate upstairs (which you will), Mottola has what you need to recreate your favourite True North Square dish in your kitchen! It's incredible how you can go and enjoy a meal at any of the attached vendors in the upstairs market and be able to buy that special sauce or, say, the Korean fried chicken to enjoy at home right downstairs at Mottola. They also have an impressive selection of ethnic, imported, health-food, and the just hard-to-find Mottola has what you need! If you prefer to leave it up to the chef and have your meal while you're at True North, there is a stunning interior lounge and large patio section for you to enjoy your meal and even a pint at one of their attached bars.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. The Forks</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Forks is already a beloved Winnipeg Spot, a hot spot for activities, shows, tours, and history. With many new exciting additions, even if you're already local to The Forks, you'll want to plan a trip there for sure. With new one-of-a-kind shops, restaurants, and even a new arcade, this old favourite feels like a new one! Relax outside or get some work done with a local craft beer from one of the great indoor or outdoor bars and lounge areas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Get To Know Downtown Winnipeg's Art, Culture, and History with a Tour!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Downtown Winnipeg is famous for its beautiful historic murals, sculptures, and various other forms of art throughout its streets. Have you ever seen a piece and wondered what the story behind it is? I know I have, and that is what is so great about the tours like the Art walk and Art ride tours. Learn all about the history of Winnipeg, its people, history, and culture while getting some exercise on a beautiful summer day! This summer, there are many fantastic walking and cycling tours throughout downtown Winnipeg to give you a taste of where Winnipeg came from and the art and culture behind it.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another exciting trip is taking the Trolley! The Trolly has been a tourist staple of downtown Winnipeg for many years already. With in-depth city tours and bookable ghost tours, they are definitely worth the ride! Prefer an indoor tour? Many of Downtown's museums offer free or affordable admission. The WAG does free exhibits and days (selected dates), as well as a discounted rate on the first Wednesday of the month for the Canadian Museum of Human Rights. But there are many other museums Downtown you can check out that offer cheap or free admission, such as the Winnipeg Police Museum.</p>

<p>4. Events</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Downtown Winnipeg is full of exciting activities all season long! Enjoy things like yoga and fitness in the park, movies, concerts, and more! Catch a free lunchtime concert with the downtown concert series! The Downtown Concert Series is a series of free concerts at various locations throughout Downtown during summer. And check out the Thursday Night concert series at The Beer Can with live outdoor shows.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Get in shape and enjoy Downtown Winnipeg! Fitness in the park offers free lunchtime classes downtown every weekday during the summer into early fall. Enjoy classes taught by top downtown instructors from top Winnipeg gyms and yoga studios.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5. Take a Downtown Patio Crawl</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enjoy a stroll downtown and some of Winnipeg's best food and patios on a Downtown patio crawl. One of the best things about being in Downtown Winnipeg is everything is relatively close to each other, including Winnipeg's best patio spots!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Forks</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can't be doing a downtown patio crawl without stopping in at Winnipeg's already favorite spot, The Forks! With two new bars, one indoor and one outdoor, an extended licensed patio seating area, and not to mention tons of delicious restaurants to pick up some fantastic food at.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>La Roca</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Closely connecting the next few stops on Smith Street is La Roca. They are known for their impressive selection of tequila, delicious Mexican cuisine, and good patio right in the heart of downtown Winnipeg!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tavern United Roof-Top</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Downtown Tavern United (<em>aka roof-top-tav</em>) has a nice rooftop patio and bar that gives you an exciting view of Downtown! Located right on between Canada Life Center and True North Square, you'll be able to see your next stop (and maybe your apartment) from there!</p>

<p>Lake Of The Woods Brewery</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Located inside True North Square, on the other side of the entrance from Mottola market is Winnipeg's own location for Lake of The Woods Brewery! Much of Winnipeg is already a big fan of the Lake of The Woods brewery and beer in Kenora, then I have great news for you! Featuring their classic brews, delicious LOTW beer-based cocktails, their classic merch line, and even take-home options for beer, you may end up making this one more of a regular stop (and they're okay with that!).</p>
