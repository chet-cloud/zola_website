Heated underground parking might seem like a luxury, but in Winnipeg it’s downright life-changing. I hate to even say the dreaded w word yet, but there are many perks to underground heated parking—especially during Winnipeg’s harsh winters! Here are some of the best reasons to look for parking underground.
<h3>No More Morning Duties</h3>
If you are like me and value your sleep, a giant perk of heated underground parking is that you save major time in the morning. Instead of waking up twenty minutes earlier to bundle up, trudge outside, and work up a sweat clearing inches of snow and ice off your car, only to then wait another miserable ten minutes for your car to warm up, you can be in bed hitting your snooze button for the third time. With heated underground parking, you don’t have to spend half of your day preparing your car for departure, you just hop in and go!

You’ll also have somewhere to plug in your car, guaranteeing it will start on those extra toe-numbing days that always come around in January. A warm underground parking spot will also protect your wheels from the elements, so it won’t be 100% dependent on being plugged in.
<h3>Keeping Your Car Clean</h3>
Winnipeg roads are the epitome of dirty—especially on groggy winter days when it’s almost impossible not to drive into a pothole full of brown slush. Sometimes, you just want to make your car all spiffy but fear the mix of the leftover water and Winnipeg’s frigid days. But if you’re headed back to your cozy, underground heated parking spot afterwards, you can scrub your car without a care in the world. Plus, underground parking ensures you’ll be taking fewer trips to the carwash by avoiding those extra splashes of dirt your car would receive parked on the street.

<h3>Keeping Your Car Safe</h3>
Your car is less likely to be dinged or damaged by passing cars when it’s parked safely underground. And if you do have the misfortune of receiving a ding from a car door or a smashed bumper, most underground parking lots have security cameras. So if the offending driver didn’t leave a note, you might be able to find out how it happened. Underground parking also helps protects you from those always ill-timed street parking break-ins.
<h3>No More Parking Tickets</h3>
“Be right back, I need to go move my car!”

Sound familiar? Underground parking also saves you from getting a parking ticket (or three). Many underground parking lots have you pick up a ticket when you enter and pay for your time when you leave. So no rushing to move your car each hour, or leaving your dinner date to go plug more quarters into the meter. If you have the option of including parking in your rent, that’s even more convenient!

<h3>Save Big on Time and Energy</h3>
Downtown Winnipeg is known for having limited parking on their streets, especially during the 9 to 5 on workdays. Parking underground may seem like a luxury, but it will save you time and energy every time you don’t need to circle the block looking for somewhere to park.
