<h2>Go on a street crawl</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>If none of the above fit your Irish appetite or you rather keep to yourself, try celebrating by going on your street crawl.

<h2>St. Patricks Day the Self Care Way; Keep Calm and Celebrate St Patrick!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you rather stay in and keep calm this St Patricks day but still want to stay in the holiday spirit, try indulging in some St Patrick day themed self-care. Start by brewing yourself an Irish coffee, run a bath with a goat’s milk soak and green-themed oils like peppermint, and let the stress melt away to the sounds of relaxing Irish music.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Hangover the Irish Way</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While St Patrick’s Day is a nationally beloved holiday, it is not exactly a nationally absorbed holiday in the way of anyone having the day off. Unlike New Year’s Eve, where we all have a national hangover day on January 1st (and most places on the 2nd too), not too many places close on St. Patricks Day. If you find yourself hungover and have to go to work this St. Patricks Day, try one of these Irish remedies.</p>
