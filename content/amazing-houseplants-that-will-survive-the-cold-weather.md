<p>For Winnipeggers, keeping the greenery in their homes throughout the cold months of winter can seem challenging. The dry air and fewer hours of light aren't the best environments for most plants. However, some indoor household plants are best suited for even the chillier rooms. Check out the top 6 cold-tolerant plants that are sure to make your house cozier and brighter.</p>

<h3>Snake Plant</h3>

<p>The Snake plant (Sansevieria) can resist low light, cool temperatures, and dry soil. This plant's variety of colors and patterns will make your home more stylish, remove toxins, and improve air quality. For better care, during the winter, let these plants dry out between waterings</p>

<h3>Geraniums</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surprisingly, Geraniums (Pelargonium) are cold-tolerant plants. The vibrant colors of its flowers will brighten your space and make it look like spring never left. Even though it is suited for chillier areas, it needs a few hours of daily sunshine.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jade (Crassula Ovata) is known for gracefully tolerating winter and summer. This thick-leaves plant, like the Geranium, needs light to survive. Well-drained soil is essential for Jade, and you should consider watering it once every two weeks.</p>

<h3>Maidenhair Fern</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7209,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7209"/></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Need a plant that will thrive in a low-light environment? Maidenhair Fern (Adiantum) is your choice. This plant can survive with indirect light, but it's essential to keep the soil humid, so it must be watered consistently and frequently.</p>

<h3>Succulents</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With many colors, patterns, and styles to choose from, succulents are probably the easiest indoor plants to take care of. Â Succulents will survive dry, cold environments and are a good option if you like to leave your plants on your windowsill. You can create a succulent terrarium, mixing and matching the different styles of these incredible and resilient plants.</p>

<h3>Fiddle Leaf </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7211,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant6.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7211"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While certain plants grow during the winter, that is not the case with Fiddle Leaf (Ficus Lirata). Because of that, you need to adjust the watering for the cold season, reducing the plant's watering to once every month if the room isn't too humid. This plant likes consistent sunlight, so it is recommended to place it in a south-facing window.</p>
