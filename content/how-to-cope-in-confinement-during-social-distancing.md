excerpt: With its unfortunate arrival at the beginning of spring, COVID-19 has dashed
  our dreams of shaking off winter hibernation and venturing back into the world.
  As the introvertiest of introverts, spending time at home is something I relish,
  but if you’re the type who likes to be on the go, you probably feel like you’re
  grounded and it wasn’t even your fault! Lucky for you, being sent to my room was
  always my punishment of choice.

<span data-contrast="auto">With its unfortunate arrival at the </span><span data-contrast="auto">beginning</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of spring, C</span><span data-contrast="auto">OVID</span><span data-contrast="auto">-19 has dashed our dreams of shaking off winter hibernation and venturing back into the world. As the introvertiest of introverts, spending time at home is something I relish, but if you’re the type who likes to be on the go, you probably feel like you’re grounded and it </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">wasn’t even your fault</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">! Lucky for you, being sent to my room was always my punishment of choice.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you’re stuck at home, here is my guide on how to cope in confinement:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>
<h3>Step 1: Take a deep breath</h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">The first thing to remember is that you’re at home, </span><span data-contrast="auto">so </span><span data-contrast="auto">relax! Easier said than done, I know. When you have places to go and people to see, you’re usually on a clearly</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">defined schedule. Since you’re </span><span data-contrast="auto">staying </span><span data-contrast="auto">home </span><span data-contrast="auto">right </span><span data-contrast="auto">now, take a deep breath and slow down: sleep in longer than usual, stay up late watching that critically</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">acclaimed movie, prepare that delicious but oh-so-time-consuming recipe. Whatever it is, take your time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Which brings me to Step 2. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>
<h3>Step 2: Appreciate the little things</h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Reacquaint yourself with how your favourite chair is comfortable in just the right way and luxuriate in the smell of your coffee. Sometimes when we’re surrounded by the same things every day, we </span><span data-contrast="auto">can’t help but </span><span data-contrast="auto">take them for granted</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Take </span><span data-contrast="auto">a moment to reflect on life’s little joys and you’ll be happier for it. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>
<h3>Step 3: Create structure</h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">To keep time from mushing together, it’s crucial to maintain at least some semblance of </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">routine. It’s easy to get caught up in the relaxing we talked about, so I recommend you </span><span data-contrast="auto">still </span><span data-contrast="auto">get out of bed before a certain time in the morning, change your clothes (you can still wear pyjamas, just different pyjamas!), and aim to eat your meals and wind down for the night around the same time each day.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6295" src="https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1024x682.jpg" alt="How to Cope in Confinement During Social Distancing, covid-19. self isolation, self quarantine, social distancing, staying home, coronavirus, working from home, non-essential worker" width="1024" height="682" />

<span data-contrast="auto">Now for the hard one:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>
<h3>Step 4: Set goals</h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">I often make lists of the things I’m looking to accomplish over the next </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">X</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> amount of time. </span><span data-contrast="auto">My goals can</span><span data-contrast="auto"> be anything from </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">do the laundry</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">conquer the world</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (though unless you plan on conquering the world from your living room, maybe save that one for later.) </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Keeping a to-do list sounds tedious, but think of </span><span data-contrast="auto">it as a </span><span data-contrast="auto">really responsible advent calendar</span><span data-contrast="auto">…where </span><span data-contrast="auto">you don’t get any chocolate and the days don’t matter</span><span data-contrast="auto">. On second thought, </span><span data-contrast="auto">forget that</span><span data-contrast="auto">—but </span><span data-contrast="auto">the point is</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> it gives you something to work towards to keep you looking forward.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The best part is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> keeping your goals in </span><span data-contrast="auto">mind as the days progress and cross</span><span data-contrast="auto">ing</span><span data-contrast="auto"> each item off your list as it’s completed (so satisfying). </span><span data-contrast="auto">Pro tip:</span><span data-contrast="auto"> In addition to keeping track of your personal projects, add all the housework you were going to do anyway</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto">. The more things on your list, the more crossing off you get to do!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">If you can’t think of anything to do, </span><span data-contrast="auto">here are some ideas to get you started. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>
<ul>
 	<li data-leveltext="★" data-font="" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Do your “I’d love to ____ if I had time” thing!</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> If there is a project you’ve been wanting to get back to (or start!), this is an excellent opportunity. I’m always in the middle of a cross stitch, sewing project, or video game, and I can’t tell you how many times someone has recommended a good book or movie and I’ve replied with “I’ll put it on the list” (</span><i><span data-contrast="auto">many!</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">).</span><span data-contrast="auto"> If there was ever a time to make it through that backlog, this is it! I might even get through a Final Fantasy game…</span></li>
</ul>

<em><b>Side note:</b></em><span data-contrast="auto"> Did you know </span><span data-contrast="auto">that you can borrow e-books and audiobooks online if </span><span data-contrast="auto">you have a library card? Audible </span><span data-contrast="auto">also </span><span data-contrast="auto">offers a selection of free audio books or a free trial of their service if you prefer someone read you a story.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}"> </span>
<ul>
 	<li data-leveltext="★" data-font="" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Try something new!</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> I spend a lot of time in the kitchen trying out new recipes and adapting old staples.

(And we’re back in the kitchen again!). Whatever your interests, online videos and blogs have made it easier than ever to learn about and get started into almost anything. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></li>

You do, right now. Building or breaking habits takes at least 21 days, so building a routine now that works for you and sticking it means </span><span data-contrast="auto">you’re more likely to keep doing it. Online videos and blogs will direct you in anything from tai-chi to strength training to zumba to yoga. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Bonus:</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Exercise also reduces stress</span><span data-contrast="auto">, and we could all use a little of that these days!</span></li>
