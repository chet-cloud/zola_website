excerpt: "The streets of downtown Winnipeg are sprinkled with apartment complexes,
  of all shapes and sizes; each one housing hundreds of apartment dwellers with their
  own story to tell about why they chose apartment living.  \n\nMany people become
  apartment dwellers for the first time during their university years, and I’m no
  exception. Choosing apartment living was sort of a no-brainer for me, especially
  living in a downtown residence—it ticked all the boxes for me. When I first began
  my apartment living journey, I was a wide-eyed twenty-something student without
  a full-time job or any major responsibilities. Apartment living fit perfectly with
  my lifestyle. As the years passed and the leases came to an end, I always found
  myself living in an apartment downtown instead of venturing off somewhere else or
  taking the financial plunge into house ownership.  "

<span data-contrast="none">One of the main reasons I chose apartment living is because I get bored super easily. I like to change up my lifestyle as often as possible and apartment living gives me that opportunity. Within downtown</span><span data-contrast="none"> Winnipeg</span><span data-contrast="none">, there are so many </span><span data-contrast="none">different areas </span><span data-contrast="none">and streets that satisfy my ever-lasting need to switch-it-up.
