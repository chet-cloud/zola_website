<span class="">The crane is up and construction is now officially underway.   This short video is a quick time-lapse showing the construction of the crane that will be used to raise the new apartment tower at Main Street and Graham Avenue. </span>

<span class=""> We are extremely excited to be underway and look forward to the next steps in this adventure.  For more information or to follow this development visit: <a href="https://300main.ca">300main.ca</a></span>
