excerpt: Setting aside the time to exercise can seem daunting. It leaves you sore,
  and there always seems to be a million other things you should be doing, but being
  active has tons of benefits—both physical and mental! I’m sure you’ve been told
  a hundred-and-one times that exercise is good for you, but has anyone told you why?

I</span><span data-contrast="auto">’m </span><span data-contrast="auto">sure you’ve been told a hundred</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">and</span><span data-contrast="auto">-</span><span data-contrast="auto">one times that exercise is good for you</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> but has anyone told you why?</span>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">Exercise Transforms Your Body</span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">The most obvious perk of working out</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is the physical change</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Exercise helps </span><span data-contrast="auto">you</span><span data-contrast="auto"> lose weight, </span><span data-contrast="auto">get toned</span><span data-contrast="auto">, gain muscle and create a healthier body! But </span><span data-contrast="auto">looking good </span><span data-contrast="auto">on the outside isn’t the only perk</span><span data-contrast="auto">:</span><span data-contrast="auto"> regular exercise can reduce your risk of serious health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and </span><span data-contrast="auto">certain </span><span data-contrast="auto">cancers. It also can </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/exercise-when-you-have-cold"><span data-contrast="none">decrease your chance of developing annoying bugs</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> such as the flu and a nasty common cold.</span>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">Exercise Makes You Feel Better</span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Need an emotional lift? Trying lifting weights! Many people hit the gym to improve their health</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><span data-contrast="auto">get a </span><span data-contrast="auto">rockin</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">bod, but</span><span data-contrast="auto"> working out has above-the-neck benefits too! Trekking a couple miles on the treadmill might seem torturous but </span><span data-contrast="auto">it’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">worth the effort. Did </span><span data-contrast="auto">you know that exercise releases </span><span data-contrast="auto">endorphins? Endorphins are what helps your brain create feelings of happiness! </span><span data-contrast="auto">So next time you </span><span data-contrast="auto">have</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a stressful day at work</span><span data-contrast="auto">, consider</span><span data-contrast="auto"> hit</span><span data-contrast="auto">ting</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the gym </span><span data-contrast="auto">instead of </span><span data-contrast="auto">the couch.</span>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">Exercise Boosts Brainpower</span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Ready to apply for a Nobel Prize? </span><span data-contrast="auto">The elliptical might bring you one step closer to that goal</span><span data-contrast="auto">! </span><span data-contrast="auto">R</span><span data-contrast="auto">igorous workouts </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-athletes-way/201310/scientists-discover-why-exercise-makes-you-smarter"><span data-contrast="none">may </span><span data-contrast="none">increase levels of a brain-derived protein</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> in the body</span><span data-contrast="auto">, w</span><span data-contrast="auto">hich is believed </span><span data-contrast="auto">to </span><a href="https://www.active.com/fitness/articles/how-exercise-boosts-your-brainpower"><span data-contrast="none">help with decision making</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, higher thinking, learning and sharpening the memory. </span><span data-contrast="auto">I</span><span data-contrast="auto">f you</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">re looking for me during exam season, you know where I’ll be!</span>

<h3><span data-contrast="auto">Exercise Gives You a Confidence Boost</span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Nothing beats that post-workout high</span><span data-contrast="auto">: </span><span data-contrast="auto">you came, you saw</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and</span><span data-contrast="auto"> you</span><span data-contrast="auto"> conquered</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Once you get that feeling, it</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">almost addicting. Working out makes us more self-confident about ourselves and our abilities. A regular workout routine can have a huge impact on your mental health, and in turn, your self-confidence—and yes, there's lots of science to back this up, my friends. </span><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/runners-high-exercise-endorphin-rush"><span data-contrast="none">Thirty minutes of moderate cardio</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is enough to release endorphins to i</span><span data-contrast="auto">ncrease feelings of well-being and self-assurance.</span>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">Get Sweating!</span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">The bottom line is </span><span data-contrast="auto">that </span><span data-contrast="auto">working out is a great way to feel better, boost your health and have fun. Exercise offers incredible benefits that can improve nearly every aspect of your health from the inside</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">out!</span>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Benefits of Having a Residential Gym</span></b></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Now imagine accessing </span><span data-contrast="auto">all of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> these benefits from the </span><span data-contrast="auto">comfort of your apartment building</span><span data-contrast="auto">!</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Having a fully equipped gym just a few floors below </span><span data-contrast="auto">your living space </span><span data-contrast="auto">opens </span><span data-contrast="auto">up</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">a whole new set of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> possibilities</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for your physical and mental self!</span>

<h3><span data-contrast="auto">Convenience</span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">I’ll be the first to admit that it can be </span><span data-contrast="auto">pretty difficult</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to motivate myself to </span><span data-contrast="auto">crawl out of my comfy bed</span><span data-contrast="auto">, jump on a bus and go to the gym. When I didn’t have the luxury of an on-site gym</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> I would often have the same conversation to myself in the morning</span><span data-contrast="auto">:</span><span data-contrast="auto"> “Okay</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> if you don’t go to the gym today</span><span data-contrast="auto">, you need to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> go tomorrow</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">” </span><span data-contrast="auto">It quickly turned into </span><span data-contrast="auto">to a never-ending cycle of bargaining </span><span data-contrast="auto">with </span><span data-contrast="auto">myself</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">W</span><span data-contrast="auto">aking up in the morning and knowing that </span><span data-contrast="auto">there’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">a gym 30 seconds away makes </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">world of difference</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">It’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">also a lot </span><span data-contrast="auto">easier to </span><span data-contrast="auto">squeeze </span><span data-contrast="auto">a workou</span><span data-contrast="auto">t into your schedule</span><span data-contrast="auto"> when </span><span data-contrast="auto">you have a fitness center in your apartment complex</span><span data-contrast="auto">!</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">Y</span><span data-contrast="auto">ou don’t have to factor in the time it takes to drive to the gym, find a parking space, and drive home. No matter how much time you have, you can walk out your front door and be exercising within five minutes!</span>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">Privacy</span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Returning to your own apartment minutes after a workout is a luxury you don’t know you</span><span data-contrast="auto">’re</span><span data-contrast="auto"> missing out on until you</span><span data-contrast="auto"> experience it</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Never </span><span data-contrast="auto">again will you </span><span data-contrast="auto">be bothered </span><span data-contrast="auto">by </span><span data-contrast="auto">cramped changing rooms or the discomfort </span><span data-contrast="auto">of </span><span data-contrast="auto">showering with strangers.</span>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">Community Spirit</span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Residential </span><span data-contrast="auto">gyms create a great community hub</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">hey</span><span data-contrast="auto">’re </span><span data-contrast="auto">a great help in building a community for</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">apartment dwellers </span><span data-contrast="auto">and their guests. It’s easy to get to know your neighbors when you work out together</span><span data-contrast="auto">!</span><span data-contrast="auto"> You can encourage each other, motivate each other and become real gym buddies.</span>
