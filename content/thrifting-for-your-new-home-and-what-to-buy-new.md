As the <a href="https://konmari.com/">Marie Kondo</a> craze sweeps the nation, everyone is decluttering their household belongings. There’s never been a better time to take advantage of the overflowing thrift stores to deck out your own space. Shopping secondhand is a win for your planet, your community, and your wallet. Now that sparks joy!
<h3>Why Thrift?</h3>
<em><strong>Environmental impact</strong></em>

Every thrifted item means one less new one produced, which is important because the production of each household item is costly to the environment. By choosing to thrift your household items, you’re helping divert used goods from landfills. Value Village alone diverts over 700 million pounds from landfills annually!

<em><strong>Social impact</strong></em>

Thrift stores make it easier to know where your money is going. For instance, one of Winnipeg’s most popular thrift stores, <a href="https://www.valuevillage.com/">Value Village</a>, donates a large portion of their proceeds back into the community.

<em><strong>Personal impact</strong></em>

My favorite item in my downtown apartment is a unique, red oak coffee table that I copped from <a href="http://canadiangoodwill.ca/">Goodwill</a> for just $12! Amazed by my deal, I looked online—similar items sold for $150. Need I say more?
<h3>How to Shop Secondhand Décor</h3>
Friendly reminder that when you buy used, you’re technically sharing with the previous owners. Check fabric and upholstered pieces carefully before making your purchase. Always check for M.O.P.S: mildew, odors, pests and stains!

<em><strong>Shop prepared</strong></em>

Knowing the measurements of the room you want to decorate is key! There’s nothing worse than coming home with your dream rug only to realize it’s way too big for your space. Measure the room beforehand, write the measurements down, and bring a measuring tape with you when you go shopping. These simple precautions will save you so much hassle.

Focus on key pieces first, rather than browsing everything. It’s easy to get overwhelmed when thrifting. You might be on a mission for a coffee table but end up lost among dozens of decorative mirrors.

<em><strong>Look for potential, not perfection</strong></em>

Thrifted goods likely won’t look perfect when you purchase them, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t right for your space.

<em><strong>Know your style</strong></em>

Combining a variety of decorating styles can be a cool, edgy look, but only when done carefully. Avoid decorating seasickness by carefully considering two questions: What’s your existing style, and what colour scheme are you going for?

You’re decorating a space that you’ll be spending a lot of time in. Make sure you like the items you bring into your space and that they reflect your personal style. You’re doing no one any good by decorating the space in fads and trends that you really don’t truly like. And having an assortment of colours and furniture can be a pretty, eccentric look, but there should always be an overall colour scheme to keep your room cohesive.
<h3>What to Buy New</h3>
<em><strong>Mattress</strong></em>

When it comes to mattress shopping, I have two words for you: bed bugs! A mattress is one of the most important things to buy after signing the lease to your new apartment. I think it goes without saying that buying a used mattress is a no-no. Bed bugs are great hitchhikers!

<em><strong>Crib</strong></em>

Having a baby is expensive, but a crib is not something you should want to skimp on. Buying a used crib is risky, because you don’t know what type of internal damage there might be.

<em><strong>Pet furniture</strong></em>

You have no way of knowing what previous pets were up to on second-hand pet beds, crates, blankets or toys. To ensure your furry friend has a clean and safe place to sit or sleep, avoid buying pet items second-hand.
