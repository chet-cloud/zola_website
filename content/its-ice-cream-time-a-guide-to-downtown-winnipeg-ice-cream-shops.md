<p>Springtime in Winnipeg means it’s time to visit your local ice cream parlour. So… do you prefer soft serve to gelato? With toppings or plain? Waffle cone or pint? No matter what your choices are, you can find it in Downtown Winnipeg. Here are my picks for the top ice cream and gelato shops:</p>

<h3>Fête Ice Cream</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Launched in 2019, Fête has practically become an instant classic for ice cream in Winnipeg. Offering made from scratch ice creams, their product is not only fresh but also delicious. They are constantly launching new flavours, and many of them inspired from our past. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Located just beside Bonnycastle Dog Park, this charming and fun ice cream shop displays a Doggie “Wall of Fame” with many pictures to celebrate their customers' furry friends.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neon Cone Ice cream parlour serves 16 flavours of hard ice cream, including 8 creamy - homemade flavours using Manitoba ingredients - 6 flavours of homemade gelato, and 3 flavours of soft ice cream. If you prefer, you can also take home some pints of ice cream, yummy!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Open all year round and late evenings in the summer, this ice cream shop is a hot spot specially if you are taking the kids out to the park. Their birthday cake flavour is a very popular choice among the little ones.</p>

<h3>Harrison's Coffee</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all know Harrison's Coffee for their amazing coffee, teas and pastries. But did you know that they sell Chaeban Ice cream?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes! They have a variety of flavours to choose from! If coffee is your preference, you can ask for an affogato or some salty Carl with a shot of espresso. That is just the perfect combination.</p>
