		"content": "Downtown living can be exciting. You\u2019re in the heart of the city with oodles of entertainment choices right outside your door. In your new digs at 300 Main, you will also have new neighbours, maybe more than you\u2019ve ever had before.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nAs adults, we sometimes have trouble making new friends and even introducing ourselves to others. Do you want your neighbours to be more than just nameless faces but don\u2019t know where to start? If so, here are five\u00a0ideas that just may get you started in meeting\u00a0those sharing your new living environment.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<h3><b>Join the Gym<\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\nAt 300 Main, you\u2019ve got some swanky new amenities, including a gym. There are many good reasons to use these facilities, the most obvious\u00a0of which are\u00a0exercise and healthy living. Yes, you could work out in your apartment, but you won\u2019t meet anyone new there. The gym will give you an opportunity to politely check out and maybe meet some of your neighbours.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1438523886290140&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\nIt can be easier to introduce yourself to someone in the gym, because you already have something in common: a desire to exercise. This gives you a ready-made topic to discuss. Does your possible new bestie have a favourite piece of equipment or a good workout tip? Starting\u00a0with\u00a0this type of safe topic gives you a chance to chat and\u00a0discover if you might have more in common. If they don\u2019t seem like buddy material, stick to your short exercise chat, then go back to working out. Having exercise to do gives you an easy excuse to extract yourself from a conversation that isn\u2019t going well. (The\u00a0introverted among us always like having an escape plan from awkward conversation.) Remember, less is more. You don\u2019t want to be the pushy type, so don\u2019t monopolize anyone for too long.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nIf your first conversation goes well, you can try to catch this person on the regular at the gym for a while. If you both seem receptive to talking outside of the gym, suggest going for drinks or coffee, something\u00a0comfortable\u00a0and short.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-184 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Friends-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" \/>\n<h3><b>Join a Social Event or Start a Social Committee<\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-225\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1024x766.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" \/>Does your building hold any social events onsite or organize any group outings? If yes, consider joining one that interests you. If you don\u2019t see any options for social gatherings, consider starting a social committee yourself. You will likely need to talk to building management first, but group outings are another great way to meet people in\u00a0low-stress situations and see if you have something in common.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nYou can also join or start a charitable endeavour in your building. There are many non-profit organizations located downtown, such as<i>\u00a0Siloam Mission<\/i><i>\u00a0<\/i>or<i>\u00a0Welcome Place<\/i>, which\u00a0have\u00a0volunteer\u00a0openings.\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively, you could\u00a0invite your apartment block or floor to\u00a0raise money as a community. Organizations like the Christmas Cheer Board are always looking for new donors.\u00a0Any\u00a0of these options\u00a0will create an opportunity for\u00a0you to meet people and help a worthy cause at the same time.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<h3><b>Start a Conversation in Common Areas<\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\nInevitably, you will see some of your new neighbours in the hall, on the elevator or in the mailroom. One of the easiest ways to meet your neighbours is to pipe up and introduce yourself in these situations. If you\u2019re an extrovert, starting conversations with complete strangers is likely an easy task for you. If you\u2019re an introvert, this will take more effort.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nStart with a\u00a0smile and\u00a0avoid coming on too strong.\u00a0Remember, you\u2019ve already got something in common: you live in the same building! Ask\u00a0what they think of the building, the gym or some other amenity. This should lead to an easy conversation. Chances are good you can converse on this topic for a few minutes, which is all you will have (at most) when you randomly run into people in your building. Remember to give your name and, if you feel comfortable, what floor you live on.\u00a0You won\u2019t hit it off with every neighbour, so don\u2019t fret if the first few conversations don\u2019t work out.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<h3><b>Advanced Technique<\/b><b>: Throw a Party!<\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\nIf you\u2019re a sociable sort and like to plan events, consider throwing a party. This might be especially welcome if everyone on the invitee list is new to the building,\u00a0since most of us like to make friends.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nIt\u2019s best to invite a smallish number of people to a party, maybe\u00a0everyone on your floor. You can knock on doors, leave messages under doors or invite people you\u2019ve met and\u00a0with whom you have already\u00a0exchanged numbers.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nKeep the\u00a0event\u00a0low key and don\u2019t try to make people do party games. Be conscientious and keep the volume down. Not everyone will\u00a0come\u00a0and you don\u2019t want to tick off the people who share your building. The party could just be an easy brunch (mimosas!) or after work drinks. You don\u2019t have to plan for a six-hour event.\u00a0If all goes well, you might make a few friends. At least you will have some friendly new acquaintances you can talk to when moving around your building.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<h3><b>Think<\/b><b>\u00a0<\/b><b>Beyond Your Building<\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<span class=\"TextRun SCXW892797\" lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW892797\">It\u2019s great to know people right in your living space, but you don\u2019t have to limit yourself to one spot. Take advantage of your location to meet other downtown denizens. You can try local coffee shops or nightclubs. If you pick a regular time to visit your favourite coffee haunt, you might spot other regulars<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW892797\" lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW892797\">\u00a0and be spotted by them<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW892797\" lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW892797\">. It will be less intimidating to start conversations with people who have seen your face a few times.<\/span><\/span>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"wp-image-187 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/meetup.en_-300x158.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" \/><\/a>You can also look for local organizations to join. There are multiple Toastmasters clubs that meet downtown. You can also check out\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/\">www.meetup.com<\/a>\u00a0to\u00a0find information about\u00a0groups or events downtown that\u00a0might interest you. You can visit the Millennium Library or sign up for some volunteer work in your neighbourhood. There are so many\u00a0options for meeting people\u00a0downtown. Pick\u00a0one and take the plunge!<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<h3><b>Starting Is Often the Hardest Part<\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\nMeeting people and making new friends can\u00a0take some work and some intentionality. Choose not to keep your head down over your phone when you\u2019re in your building.\u00a0 Show your neighbours you are open to connecting by smiling, making eye contact, and\u00a0saying\u00a0\u201chi\u201d when you\u00a0can. The truth is, many people are shy and just need an invitation to strike up a conversation.\u00a0\u00a0Before long, you\u2019ll discover that \u201crenters\u201d have become \u201cneighbours\u201d, and \u201cneighbours\u201d have become friends.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>",

Josh, better known amongst his peers as \u201c@yoshigrams\u201d, is dangling his feet from a rooftop in the historic Exchange District awaiting the first signs of light. His mission on this crisp September morning is to capture the first beams of sunlight as they rise to cascade over the array of brick buildings set in Chicago style. The aged brick buildings proudly display the remnants of hand painted ads and signs from years past. These ghosted-signed walls will serve as today\u2019s backdrop. Sitting outside in the brisk weather patiently waiting for the sun\u2019s first light is a small price to pay for the stunning photo he will capture today through the\u00a0lense\u00a0of his trusty and well-loved camera.\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nJosh is not alone in his mission to capture the city\u2019s downtown core and the people calling it home. This group of talented and creative Winnipeg photographers, whether they know it or not, is quickly changing the way in which we view our city of just over 700,000 residents.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nFor many, downtown Winnipeg has become a focal point and hub for\u00a0photography\u00a0thanks in part to its diverse cityscapes and character. A mix of late 1800s Chicago-style architecture that inhabits the Exchange, along with sporadic growth and revitalization in the downtown core, have all played a part in this resurgence of interest. New projects and spaces like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.truenorthsquare.com\/\">True North Square<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/humanrights.ca\/\">Museum of Human Rights<\/a>, and the renovation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wcc.mb.ca\/\">Winnipeg Convention Centre<\/a> have captured the imagination of many\u2013tourists and Winnipeggers alike. This diverse area encompasses approximately 179.18 square miles and is enjoyably explored on foot or bicycle. One can cover a large portion of the downtown area in a 15-minute bike ride or 20-minute walk from Portage and Main; that is all the distance separating the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theforks.com\/eat-and-drink\/dine\/the-common\">Commons at the Forks Market<\/a> from the steps of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.mb.ca\/legislature\/visiting\/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building<\/a> or the heart of the Exchange and Provencher Bridge.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_251\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"940\"]<img class=\"wp-image-251 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Provencher-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"529\" \/> Photo by Joe Lu[\/caption]\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nTo what do we attribute this influx and growth of interest in photography? We could sit around and debate the influence of good-quality and accessible entry-level camera gear, the evolution of the cell phone camera, or the popularity of photo sharing apps like Instagram and VSCO. While these all come into play, I think there\u2019s something bigger and deeper at the heart of it all. I see a vast number of up-and-coming photographers with a yearning for adventure who are finding it all in their own backyard: Downtown Winnipeg.\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_264\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"450\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BkDJcrRh9sw\/\"><img class=\"wp-image-264\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/by-Mike-Peters-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" \/><\/a> Photo by Mike Peters @93mp[\/caption]\n\nThis growing talent pool have proven their ability to capture the same city and locations in contrasting and unique shooting and editing styles. I can\u2019t help but think that this friendly competition is the reason we are seeing such imagery evolving. While some may choose to shoot strictly on iPhones and\u00a0others prefer investing in higher-end DSLRs, the well of creativity does not run dry. From romanticized skylines to whimsical street views. the variety of ways we can view our city has never been as interesting, as beautiful, or as diverse. This wave of both established and up-and-coming artists are transforming the mundane streets and views into beautiful works of art, ready to be hung on gallery and condo walls alike.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nAnd it is not just the aesthetic quality these photos possess, but the way in which they engage the viewer. Sometimes a familiar space is seen in a new light or a recommendation unintentional is offered. Leveraging tools like social media have forged new paths for us to journey along with photographers as they explore the downtown. Thanks to apps like VSCO and Instagram, we find ourselves consistently screenshotting images taken by some of our favourite Winnipeg photographers. It might be a simple reminder to order a print or, even more often, a reminder to add a specific location to our \u201cTo Do and See\u201d list.\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nOn my phone amongst the clutter is an album labelled \u201cTo Do and See.\u201d I enjoy photography, though I am far from accomplished; perhaps even labelling it a \u201chobby\u201d is a statement of generosity.\u00a0 But in the interests of inspiring other local, amateur photographers to grab their camera of choice and hit the pavement for adventure, I took a minute to map out one of my recent excursions.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_280\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BRHsmeHAepw\/\"><img class=\"wp-image-280\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" \/><\/a> Photo by Manny Berkal-Sarbit @leggrease[\/caption]\n\nFrom the steps of 300 Main, camera in tow, I hang a right and walk the 7 minutes to Via Rail Union Station to marvel at the building interior. I have been here before, but years ago when I did not have the appreciation I do now. Not many people know that the Historic Building built in 1908 through 1909 was designed by Warren and Wetmore, architects of New York\u2019s Grand Central Station.\u00a0 A few years back, an image of this space captured by Josh helped me to appreciate the intricate workings of the inner dome-shaped ceiling.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nI keep moving. Depending on the time of year and day, it looks like I am heading west to grab a couple of photos at Upper Fort Garry Park. I have driven by on a weekly basis for\u00a0many\u00a0years, yet I desire to take it in first-hand.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to believe that more than 400 feet of steel and light went into the installation that scribe three continuous lines tracing the history of western Canada and of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.upperfortgarry.com\/\">Upper Fort Garry<\/a>.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nTime for some refreshment. I am sitting down for a drink at the Sky Lounge behind Hotel Fort Garry. Sky Lounge offers a stunning skyline view overlooking downtown and the Forks and is located just a few floors from Prairie 360, with views of the city in its entirety. If the day was still\u00a0young\u00a0I may rather have opted to grab a coffee at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foolsandhorses.ca\/\">Fools + Horses<\/a> en route to lunch, served up on Broadway courtesy of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theredember.com\/\">Red Ember Food<\/a> truck just a block west from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foolsandhorses.ca\/\">Fools + Horses<\/a>.\u00a0\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nAt this point I have a few options. Option one, I can cross the street and do a self-guided tour of the Manitoba Legislative Building, hoping to adequately capture the extensive masonry work and do my best to make out the Hermetic Code written in stone (literally). Option two, I can walk up a block to hit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wag.ca\/\">WAG<\/a>\u2019s rooftop terrace or walk to the top of The Bay parkade across the street. These are some of the greatest vantage points of downtown and all it has to offer. Option three, I can venture North and check out the newly renovated Winnipeg Convention Centre (which has some awesome exterior textures and lighting) before sitting down in True North Square to do some skyward shooting.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nNo matter which of these options I choose, I am then heading Northeast to continue the journey in the Exchange District. There I will capture some street scenes reminiscent of Chicago, some ghost signs that decorate the building landscape, and then stop for a bite at either <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kingandbannatyne.com\/\">King +\u00a0Bannatyne<\/a>\u00a0or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deerandalmond.com\/\">Deer + Almond<\/a> before seeing who or what I can capture at the\u00a0the\u00a0Cube Stage in Old Market Square.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_267\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bj2RcGZnbR9\/\"><img class=\"wp-image-267\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/by-Mike-Peters-2-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" \/><\/a> Photo by Mike Peters @93mp[\/caption]\n\nMy last route will be Waterfront Drive, making my way Southeast to capture <a href=\"https:\/\/goldeyes.com\/shaw-park\/\">Shaw Park<\/a> with the arches of Provencher Street Bridge in the background. My final stop will be the ever-popular Museum of Human Rights. All said and done, I will have covered a good portion of downtown Winnipeg\u2013Broadway\u2013Assiniboine, South Portage, the Exchange District, Waterfront and the Forks. I will leave Central Park and Chinatown for my next adventure. All these places and spaces appeared on my timeline at some point; and it was either the lighting or composition that caught my attention in a way I had not viewed before.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nAs Winnipeg\u2019s downtown continues its renaissance, city dwellers and tourists alike are rediscovering all it has to offer. A vibrant city requires an active heart; a central core. Winnipeg has always possessed this active heart, yet at some points in time\u00a0the\u00a0vital signs have been\u00a0seemingly\u00a0weak. When the city of Winnipeg refocused its vision back to making a beautiful and accessible downtown, Winnipeggers took note.

		"content": "Let\u2019s play a game. Take a moment and peek into your garbage can. For every fruit or vegetable scrap, eggshell, pile of coffee grinds or pizza crust you see, give yourself a point. For this game we\u2019re playing by golf rules: the lower the points, the higher the score. How did you do?\n\nFood scraps comprise a large portion of Canadian waste-bin space, but they don\u2019t belong there! Don\u2019t let being an apartment dweller prevent you from composting and living your best eco-friendly life.\n\nDon\u2019t know where to begin? Here are some quick and easy tips on how you can gain your environmental karma back.\n<h4>Worm Bin<\/h4>\nFor most urban renters, a compost bin is probably the best solution. Worm compost bins are one of the most resourceful compost options available for apartment dwellers. The worm method is portable and quick, as worms help process your household waste and produce nutrient-rich \u201cworm-tea\u201d\u2014a beneficial addition to the soil of your household plants.\n<h4><em>DIY Worm Compost Bin<\/em><\/h4>\nPurchase a medium to large plastic bin with two lids: one for the top and the other to place under the bottom. Poke a few, scattered holes in the bottom of the bin for drainage, and a few holes in the top of the lid for ventilation. Place the second lid underneath the bin to catch liquid.\n\nNow onto the wiggly night-crawlers.\n\nYou can purchase worms in various places around Winnipeg: your local garden centre, a vermicomposting facility (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.naturesperfectplantfood.com\">www.naturesperfectplantfood.com<\/a>), or even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kijiji.ca\/\">Kijiji<\/a>, just to name a few. To make the bin feel like home for the worms, soak the bin with water and line the sides and bottom of the bin with shredded newspapers. Lastly, spread a little soil over the paper and plop in those slimy fellas.\n\nNow that you have prepared the compost bin, you can begin throwing in your food scraps. To avoid odors and to guarantee more efficient composting, be sure to continue adding more damp newspaper strips, leaves and\/or dirt along with your scraps.\n<h4>Compost Bin Without the Worms<\/h4>\nIf you\u2019re not fond of worms, you need not include them! Follow the steps above and simply omit the worms; just be prepared for the food to take a bit longer to break down.\n<h4><em>Where to Store your Bin<\/em><\/h4>\nDetermine the best place for you. Common locations are under the sink, in an infrequently used closet, on the balcony, or even in a window flower box.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_405\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"940\"]<img class=\"wp-image-405 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" \/> Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash[\/caption]\n<h4>Freezer Composting<\/h4>\nThe benefit of keeping compost in your freezer is that you don\u2019t have to worry about maintaining the compost bin and it\u2019s out of sight, out of mind.\n\nSlide that tub of Ben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream and that freezer-burned hamburger meat to one side to clear up some space. You can use brown paper bags, compostable plastic bags or a freezer-safe jar or tub. This composting solution is great for dropping your food waste straight from the chopping board.\n\nThe only downside to this alternative is that you\u2019ll be taking more trips to dispose of your composting drop-off.\n<h4><em>Where to Take Your Compost<\/em><\/h4>\nCompost can be dropped off at various locations around the city.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/greenactioncentre.ca\/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-346 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/green-action-centre-300x143.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"143\" \/><\/a>\n\nGreen Action Centre (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.greenactioncentre.ca\">www.greenactioncentre.ca<\/a>) provides a list of local places that accept compost waste; and if you\u2019re really dedicated, Compost Winnipeg (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.compostwinnipeg.ca\">www.compostwinnipeg.ca<\/a>) offers home compost pick-up for a small fee. Alternatively, you might consider approaching a local community garden with an offering of your compost.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.compostwinnipeg.ca\/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-345 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Compost-Winnipeg-300x110.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"110\" \/><\/a>\n<h4>Blender Composting<\/h4>\nThis method is for those who want to compost their extra food bits a bit faster!\n\nYou can use your blender to break down food scraps\u2014though I would recommend skipping the avocado pits or anything too tough for your blender to tackle. Go ahead and throw those egg shells, coffee grinds, and fruit peels into the blender, add some water and let it rumble.\n\nYou can easily dispose of this compost smoothie by adding small amounts to the soil of your indoor plants, or by pouring it into a flowerbed or soil patch near your apartment. With the onset of our traditional Winnipeg six-month winters, ask your friends or work colleagues if they have an outdoor compost bin you can use during the snowy months, or contact your local indoor greenhouses\/gardens.\n\nLastly, have fun with composting! Don\u2019t think of it as a chore. It will soon become routine, just like separating your recycling from the rest of your garbage. You just may inspire your other apartment-dwelling friends and neighbours to take on an eco-friendlier lifestyle.",

How can you make this space a reflection of who you are and who you want to be? For your guests, how can your apartment\u00a0be\u00a0comfortable, modern and inviting? The challenge is to create a space you look forward to coming home to at the\u00a0end\u00a0of a day, and to like it enough that you feel free to invite in friends, family and neighbors.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nLiving in a small apartment doesn\u2019t mean your space\u00a0has to\u00a0be\u00a0boring.\u00a0If you are living in downtown Winnipeg\u2019s Exchange District, you are already surrounded by some of the most historic and beautiful architecture in Western\u00a0Canada. Looking out of your window every morning is your first source of inspiration for your\u00a0downtown\u00a0apartment d\u00e9cor!\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nLet me give you a few more sources of inspiration. Here are\u00a0<em><b>seven easy tips to decorate your apartment with style.<\/b><\/em>\n<h3><b>1. Decide what you want to say through the interior design of your apartment<\/b>.<\/h3>\n\nOur houses show the world who we are just as our\u00a0clothing\u00a0does.\u00a0It is said, \u201cDress to impress. Dress for success.\u201d I would also say, \u201cDress up your house so people can know\u00a0who you are and what you\u2019re about.\u201d I love looking at\u00a0the\u00a0small details\u00a0of\u00a0someone\u2019s home.\u00a0Books on shelves, pictures on walls,\u00a0and\u00a0decor from foreign countries can tell a lot about\u00a0the\u00a0dweller.\u00a0How do\u00a0you want\u00a0people\u00a0to\u00a0feel\u00a0or what do you want them to know about you\u00a0when they walk into your apartment?\u00a0\u201cHe must be a musician, I see\u00a0sheet\u00a0music\u00a0all around\u00a0and a guitar right there in the corner\u201d;\u00a0or \u201cI love those strict and simple lines\u00a0of\u00a0his furniture. He must be a pragmatic and realistic person.\u201d When I\u00a0lived\u00a0in a small studio in downtown Winnipeg, I placed an open easel right beside the window\u00a0along with\u00a0oil colors\u00a0and canvases. I didn't have to say a single word to my guests about who I am\u00a0or what I\u00a0value.\u00a0They\u00a0could see a creative woman living in that studio just because an easel\u00a0was a part\u00a0of the\u00a0interior.\n\n<center> <a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/pin\/514888169892992854\/\"><\/a> <\/center>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>2. Minimalism, modern, boho\u2026step number two is to\u00a0<b>decide on the style<\/b>.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\nThere are many sources of inspiration for new\u00a0style\u00a0ideas. However, before you start browsing the internet and\u00a0designer\u00a0magazines, make a list of what you like. Try to list colors, shades, lines and textures. Your perfect home\u2014what does it look like? Does it have darker or lighter furniture? Would you prefer surrounding yourself with books, pillows and candles, or\u00a0do you feel more relaxed in an\u00a0empty and open space?\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nWhen your list seems complete, it\u2019s time to start browsing. You need to describe the desired style in one word. Why? Let me give you an example based on minimalistic style. You decided that Scandinavian minimalism makes your heart beat faster. When your eyes rest on perfect wooden details, grey couches, potted plants in nooks and on sills, you\u00a0are\u00a0in love.\u00a0This Scandinavian minimalism will become your base. White, grey and cold dusty blue will be the palette for this minimalistic style. Interior design has the same building techniques as clothing capsule; you will build, add, and create from your base. When you have a strong base,\u00a0incorporating items and accessories\u00a0from a different style\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0ruin your look; the spirit of your\u00a0space\u00a0will remain the same.\n\n<center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/pin\/114630753000986248\/\"><\/a><\/center>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>3. Mix them all up!<\/b><\/h3>\nIn step two, you\u2019ve done the hard work of finding one style\u00a0to act as a\u00a0strong base. Step three is more fun! If you want to add more life,\u00a0more chic,\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0professional-looking vibe to your place - mix styles. You might have a very simple grey couch in minimalistic style, but the coffee table, rugs, and\u00a0wall\u00a0prints\u00a0are\u00a0funky in a creative or modern style. Mix modern and classic, urban and traditional; many interior designers use this method. It helps breathe a sense of life into a space.\n<h3><b>4. Add textures.<\/b><\/h3>\nEven the most minimalistic person with the most minimalistic interior design would love to cuddle up under a warm throw on a cold winter evening. Texture adds comfort. Look for textured pillows, curtains, blankets and rugs. Textured curtains with a print mounted close to the ceiling can be a great way to add some visual height to apartment walls.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/pin\/275634439666792944\/\"><\/a><\/center>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>5.

Among other interesting items, I have\u00a0found\u00a01920\u2019s picture frames, extravagant lamps, and even an umbrella holder.\u00a0Antique stores and flea markets\u00a0are full of hidden gems that\u00a0have the power to\u00a0make your place look special. We\u2019ve all been in a house or apartment that presents the finest furniture, yet it feels plastic and fake. There is no spirit of home. These houses do not reflect the owner\u2019s vision; on the contrary,\u00a0those\u00a0expensive,\u00a0perfect\u00a0pieces of\u00a0furniture\u00a0only bring with them an impersonal feeling of coldness.\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nIf you, on the other hand, are the owner of a basic, simple couch, what\u00a0is the trick to\u00a0making\u00a0your place look\u00a0and feel interesting and inviting?\u00a0Try displaying vintage photo frames with pictures\u00a0of your happy self or your cat\u00a0(or better yet--you with your cat!), or the people most\u00a0important in your life. If vintage details are not your thing, do the\u00a0opposite.\u00a0Allow yourself to splurge on\u00a0just one\u00a0unique and\u00a0funky looking piece of\u00a0furniture, a piece which will express your style and personality.\u00a0It might be a sofa chair with curved legs,\u00a0or\u00a0a set of\u00a0bar\u00a0chairs\u00a0offering an unusual shape, shade or aesthetic detail.\u00a0Don\u2019t\u00a0shy away from\u00a0bringing interesting pieces into your life.\u00a0Have fun creatively\u00a0incorporating\u00a0into your d\u00e9cor items\u00a0that are particularly meaningful to you; pieces\u00a0with history\u00a0or which have a story to tell.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<h3><b>6.

		"content": "Winnipeg\u2019s world-famous Exchange District has more to offer than just great architecture. This vibrant, eclectic area is our hub of arts and culture, and it\u2019s only a few blocks from your doorstep.\n\nWhile the Exchange is known by Winnipeggers as one neighbourhood, it\u2019s split down the middle by Main Street; and each side has its unique handful of interesting, artsy or tasty experiences.\n\nThe East Exchange is home to live theatre, the museum and the symphony, while the West Exchange is home to art galleries, shopping and movies you can\u2019t see anywhere else in the city. Both have cozy cafes promising your favourite latte, and moody bars serving creative and delicious cocktails. This is just a small taste of what the Exchange has to offer. To get you started, I\u2019ve put together my own list of great things to see and do on both sides of the Exchange.\n<h2>East Exchange Highlights<\/h2>\n<h3>Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre<\/h3>\n174 Market Avenue\n<a href=\"https:\/\/royalmtc.ca\/home.aspx\">royalmtc.ca<\/a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_534\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BpXpUM7n88L\/\"><img class=\"wp-image-534 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg.jpg\" alt=\"Sense and Sensibility, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Winnipeg Downtown, Show, Entertainment\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" \/><\/a> Sense and Sensibility ? by @leifnorman[\/caption]\n\nLet the red neon light installation (it\u2019s a Winnipeg landmark!) guide you to the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Royal MTC). The Royal MTC was Canada\u2019s first English Language regional theatre. It was created in 1958 by (then) Artistic Director <a href=\"http:\/\/www.canadiantheatre.com\/dict.pl?term=Hirsch%2C%20John%20Stephen\">John Hirsch<\/a> and General Manager <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhs.mb.ca\/docs\/people\/hendry_tb.shtml\">Tom Hendry<\/a>\u2014the two guys immortalized in the statue out front.\n\nEvery season there are ten plays offered at either the Tom Hendry mainstage or the John Hirsch Warehouse.\n<h3>Centennial Concert Hall<\/h3>\n555 Main Street\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.winnipegarchitecture.ca\/centennial-concert-hall\/\">winnipegarchitecture.ca\/centennial-concert-hall<\/a>\n\n<a title=\"Centennial Concert Hall\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/loriwhelan\/18158613780\/in\/photolist-tEBDeW-99y29b-99uRRp-99uSUx-99uRuM-99xZwY-99uU1V-99y1KS-99y2hs-99y2P5-99xZ9m\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/farm1.staticflickr.com\/491\/18158613780_147200b81f_c.jpg\" alt=\"Centennial Concert Hall\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" \/><\/a><script async src=\"\/\/embedr.flickr.com\/assets\/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\nWhile it\u2019s true the Brutalist architectural style makes the Centennial Concert Hall a divisive landmark, there\u2019s no denying the importance of this building. The decadent interior hosts not only the <a href=\"https:\/\/wso.ca\/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra<\/a>, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/wnmf.ca\/\">New Music Festival<\/a>, concerts, and a variety of speakers.\n<h3>Manitoba Museum<\/h3>\n90 Rupert Avenue\n<a href=\"https:\/\/manitobamuseum.ca\/main\/\">manitobamuseum.ca<\/a>\n\n<center>[video width=\"640\" height=\"428\" mp4=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/by-Manitoba-Museum.mp4\"][\/video]<\/center>Have you been to the museum lately? It\u2019s changed since your elementary school field trip (though the bison diorama is still there to greet you). The Manitoba Museum offers a variety of exhibits and displays that appeal to kids and adults alike. The Science Gallery on the lower level invites hands-on experiments and race-car construction for kids. Take in a show at the Planetarium while you\u2019re there. Even better, the museum now hosts after-hours events for adults. (Think tours with cocktails!)\n<h3>The Mitchell Block<\/h3>\n173 McDermot Avenue\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.themitchellblock.ca\/\">themitchellblock.ca<\/a>\n\nStart off your night on a tasty note with dinner at the Mitchell Block. The menu changes frequently, but one thing you can count on is delicious homemade pastas and a warm ambience.\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting something lighter and more casual, the sister restaurant upstairs (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wetanddrydept.com\/\">Wet &amp; Dry Dept.<\/a>) offers cocktails and appetizers.\n<h3>Forth<\/h3>\n171 McDermot Avenue\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.forth.ca\/\">www.forth.ca<\/a>\n\nRight next door from The Mitchell Block is Forth. This historic building was carefully renovated and has become one of the nicest spots in Winnipeg since it opened.\n\nThe main floor has a caf\u00e9 offering a well-curated menu of small bites to complement the coffee and drink menu. The basement has one of the coziest\/moodiest bars in the city and there\u2019s even a rooftop bar open in the evenings (weather permitting). You\u2019ll find a cocktail list that\u2019s more creative than what you might be used to.\n<h3>Waterfront Drive and Stephen Juba Park<\/h3>\nSometimes going for a walk is the best way to fall in love with an area. Waterfront Drive and Stephen Juba Park bookend the East Exchange and offer lush greenspace and a way to \u201cget away\u201d without really going anywhere.\n<h2>West Exchange Highlights<\/h2>\n<h3>Artspace Building<\/h3>\n100 Arthur Street\n<a href=\"https:\/\/art-space.ca\/\">art-space.ca<\/a>\n\nLike an apartment building with a bunch of cool tenants, this building is home to a diverse group of arts and culture organizations that make Winnipeg a better place.\n\nFrom <a href=\"http:\/\/platformgallery.org\/\">PLATFORM: Centre for Photographic + Digital Arts<\/a>\u00a0to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.videopool.org\/\">Video Pool<\/a>, you could spend a lot of time wandering Artspace\u2019s halls.\n\nBe sure to check out what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.winnipegfilmgroup.com\/cinematheque\/\">Cinematheque<\/a> is showing.\n<h3>Old Market Square<\/h3>\n<span class=\"tribe-street-address\">133 Albert Street<\/span>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.exchangedistrict.org\/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square\/\">exchangedistrict.org\/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square\/<\/a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_556\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BoXeHtRHBDs\/\"><img class=\"wp-image-556\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Nuit Blanche, Old Market Square, The Cube, Exchange District, Downtown\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" \/><\/a> Nuit Blanche at the Cube, Old Market Square by Liz Tran[\/caption]\n\nIt may seem like this patch of greenspace in the middle of the Exchange is too small to be a destination, but during the summer it's a hub for music, drama and the arts.\n\nIn June, the TD Winnipeg International <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jazzwinnipeg.com\/\">Jazz Festival<\/a>\u00a0hosts free outdoor stage concerts. In July, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.winnipegfringe.com\/\">Winnipeg Fringe Festival<\/a>\u00a0and the <a href=\"https:\/\/srfwpg.blogspot.com\/\">Soca Reggae Festival<\/a>\u00a0take the stage. In August you can enjoy the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.memefest.ca\/\">Manitoba Electronic Music Festival<\/a>. Between these events you\u2019ll see plenty of people making use of the space and making Old Market Square a central location for hanging out downtown.\n<h3>Boutique Anya<\/h3>\n88 Albert Street\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.boutiqueanya.com\/\">boutiqueanya.com<\/a>\n\nStop by this stylish and minimalist boutique to pick up something to wear for your night out. Anya has pieces you won\u2019t find anywhere else in Winnipeg.\n<h3>Tiny Feast<\/h3>\n217 McDermot Avenue\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tinyfeast.com\/\">tinyfeast.com<\/a>\n\nThis store has the notebook you didn\u2019t know you needed. \u201cTiny Feast\u201d is a phrase the owners coined; a metaphor that\u2019s used to \u201cdescribe a variety of things that feel celebratory, lavish, almost extravagant\u2014yet are intrinsically simple and useful, and therefore justifiably attainable on a personal, everyday level.\u201d Stationery, gifts and other interesting items, shopping here is a feast in which you should indulge.\n<h3>Cordova Tapas and Wine<\/h3>\n93 Albert Street\n<a href=\"https:\/\/cordovatapas.bar\/\">cordovatapas.bar<\/a>\n\nThis intimate space has an extensive (and delicious) wine and tapas menu. What could be better than enjoying a glass of wine and a few one-bite dishes with friends?\n<h3>Natural Cycleworks<\/h3>\n91 Albert Street\n<a href=\"http:\/\/naturalcycle.ca\/cycleworks\/\">naturalcycle.ca\/cycleworks<\/a>\n\nDown the flight of stairs at 91 Albert Street you\u2019ll find one of the best bike shops in the city. This worker co-op (the people who work there also own it) has been around for a long time\u2014and they know bikes. Natural Cycleworks offers full bike service year-round, custom built bikes, and is committed to recycling and resource conservation. With all those fancy new bike lanes in our downtown, this is your place to get geared up for a ride.\n\nLiving downtown provides you quick access to Winnipeg\u2019s vibrant arts and culture scene. The Exchange District, whether East or West, is brimming with new and fantastic things to taste, see and experience.\n\nThis is my list\u2014what\u2019s yours? Share your comments on your favourite spots in the Exchange.",

All within walking distance from 300 Main Street, Winnipeg houses five top-of-the-line sporting venues that attract visitors and athletes from all over Canada and beyond. If you haven\u2019t yet, it\u2019s time to check these out\u2014and if you live in an apartment downtown, you don\u2019t even need to worry about parking.

And it\u2019s a well-deserved crown. The Jets have earned a reputation as being one of the best teams in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhl.com\/\">National Hockey League<\/a>. With young stars such as Patrik Laine, Nikolaj Ehlers, Mark Scheifele, Kyle Connor and Connor Hellebuyck making headway, this can\u2019t-miss team has been drawing not only national, but world-wide attention for their fast and fluid style of hockey.\n\nIt\u2019s an expensive night out if you plan on taking a date to a Winnipeg Jets game, but it\u2019s usually worth it. In the heart of downtown, there\u2019s no bigger gem than the beautiful Bell MTS Place. Built in 2004 and standing on the former Eatons site, the arena is owned by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment, a company which also owns the Winnipeg Jets. They put out a product that is highly entertaining to watch night in and night out; you\u2019ll leave with no regrets.\n\nWinnipeg has a long and rich history of being a serious-minded hockey town, dating back to the early days of the sport when the Winnipeg Victorias won three Stanley Cups in the early 1900\u2019s. Later, in 1920, the Winnipeg Falcons (a team of Icelanders from the West End of town) captured the first-ever Olympic gold medal in ice hockey. It\u2019s only fitting that Winnipeg would erect an enormous hockey arena and stadium right in the centre of its downtown. You can\u2019t be a downtown Winnipegger without taking in at least one Jets game this season.\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uwinnipeg.ca\/recreation-services\/duckworth-centre\/index.html\">University of Winnipeg\u2014Duckworth Centre<\/a><\/h3>\n<a title=\"2013-01-26 Pandas vs Wesmen\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sangudo\/8439115766\/in\/photolist-dRJF6Y-9Y9KHn-8N7bE8-pVgMqQ-qiT7fm-8dzhLc-owCXRK-9zXNdZ-5WvkZg-ouZHKh-p1RBK8-GsTV7z-q2LE7K-asqBwD-qcz3eT-a1udwZ-ox6TwZ-9Y9D7H-q2uqwa-qaCqU7-9XTmYj-FoWbn-RVuq7V-ofzeaT-q2NkLa-odPGow-FtxtW2-q2Nzve-q2u6Za-qKB2un-oeZ38t-qj3q7e-6TjfKJ-89DAkC-pnaM8a-bHRS2T-pmW7io-6TepQT-oy9MRD-8CAxv7-pmXsGs-pnc2Mt-6TiMnJ-ouCk85-6K5hs2-qcqveo-owqCk4-YoJBW6-pnrSnh-KCiTZW\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/farm9.staticflickr.com\/8367\/8439115766_bcb1f4d59b.jpg\" alt=\"2013-01-26 Pandas vs Wesmen\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" \/><\/a><script async src=\"\/\/embedr.flickr.com\/assets\/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>At the University of Winnipeg campus on Portage Avenue you\u2019ll find the beautiful Duckworth Centre, home to the University of Winnipeg\u2019s Wesmen basketball and volleyball teams.

It\u2019s one of the oldest curling clubs in the world and certainly the oldest in Western Canada.\n\nAffectionately known to curling fans as the \"Mother Club\", the Granite has produced countless Canadian and world champions. The original Granite Curling Club dates all the way back to 1880. In its current downtown location, the Tudor-framed clubhouse was built in 1913 and is recognized as an official historic site of Manitoba. It is often considered to be the \"St. Andrews\" of curling because of its contribution to the sport in curling's mecca.\n\nIf you have a free winter evening and you\u2019re a sports fan looking for something to do, stop on by the Granite and have a drink, watch some curling and have a good time! If you like what you see, sign up for a league and try out the game for yourself. Did you know curling is making a comeback and is one of the fastest growing sports in the prairies? Join the enthusiasm and wrangle in some friends to join a team with you.\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/goldeyes.com\/shaw-park\/\">Winnipeg Goldeyes\u2014Shaw Park<\/a><\/h3>\n<a title=\"St Paul Saints vs Winnipeg Goldeyes @ CHS field\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/evilfoo\/19716053528\/in\/photolist-w3eVPo-6Lnbv7-cGQoXf-cGQpeC-6ywTJt-cGQptu-eBz8S2-cGQmW3-cGQnwJ-4T86bw-MKkv3-59mv7D-574iVb-p9LAMF-4Amjpk-V5WJFu-o9oecJ-6DWAb5-7GFGnk-cGQiXj-6KrUpV-7mFcWn-oqT3gB-85wggY-cGQq6Q-orFMTB-cFrA7f-a5NTq8-cGQpGQ-6KvYBw-adpH4a-9VC2vz-6KrSQz-6KrXSz-6Ks4HX-22B4uKP-6y8QEt-6KrYkM-56Z8Gx-cGQqUN-6xRZqe-6vJdFJ-3gfQAA-5jGq55-eCVFG6-6KwyN7-21wkAEy-orFMLH-ac8fPj-2kB35B\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img src=\"https:\/\/farm1.staticflickr.com\/427\/19716053528_cdc55240db_b.jpg\" alt=\"St Paul Saints vs Winnipeg Goldeyes @ CHS field\" width=\"1024\" height=\"311\" \/><\/a><script async src=\"\/\/embedr.flickr.com\/assets\/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>It\u2019s hard to think of a better summertime sports option than watching a Winnipeg Goldeyes game over at Shaw Park. When tickets can be had for as little as $9, it\u2019s a no-brainer for an evening of fun. Centrally located, adjacent to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theforks.com\/\">The Forks<\/a> (local beers and snacks of every ethnicity) and across the street from the <a href=\"http:\/\/Canadian Museum for Human Rights\">Canadian Museum for Human Rights<\/a>, you could even make a whole-day excursion out of a Goldeyes Game.\n\nWhile Winnipeggers (understandably) tend to fixate on the Jets and their standings, let\u2019s take a moment to point out that the Goldeyes are one of the better baseball teams in the American Association, winning two league championships in the past three years. Even if you\u2019re not an outspoken baseball fan, it\u2019s worth your time just to see former MLB slugger Reggie Abercrombie hit some homeruns for the Goldeyes.\n\nHave you ever wondered why they\u2019re called the Goldeyes, anyway? Here\u2019s a piece of sports trivia: The club is named after the goldeye, a fish often served as a smoked delicacy and commonly called Winnipeg Goldeye. So why not take in a Goldeyes\u2019 game and then smoke up some goldeye when you get back to your apartment after the game? That\u2019s the make of a true Winnipegger.\n\nThat\u2019s only the beginning of the list of downtown stops for Winnipeg sports enthusiasts. Comment on your favorite spot for sports in downtown Winnipeg. We\u2019d love to hear from you.",

		"content": "Is your kitchen bursting at the seams? Don\u2019t hide from your culinary creativity because of a mess! Here are five ways to keep your kitchen from looking like a hurricane made landfall in your cupboards.\n<h3>1. Learn to love your Tupperware<\/h3>\nThe dreaded Tupperware cupboard: we all have one. Despite the mysterious lids and tumbling bottoms, tackling this beast doesn\u2019t need to be intimidating. For a smooth post-dinner clean-up, invest in a simple file organizer. Yes\u2014the file organizer on your desk can be put to work in your kitchen, too. Slide lids in one organizer and containers in another to make packing up leftovers a cinch.\n<h3>2. High rise<\/h3>\nDon\u2019t compromise your charming mug collection just because you\u2019re short on storage. Get the most out of the space you have by thinking vertical! Adding a shelf riser is a quick fix that lets you store more by instantly turning one shelf into two. With all that extra space, why not see what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tinyfeast.com\/\">Tiny Feast<\/a> has in stock to add to your collection?\n<h3>3. Stash away your sprays<\/h3>\nThe cupboard under the sink\u2014also known as the \u201cI\u2019ll just throw it under there\u201d shelf\u2014is an organizing challenge. Finding that one particular kitchen cleaner can be easy with a little creativity: buy a tension rod (the kind you use to hang a shower curtain) and install it under the cupboard. Hook sprays on the rod to create more room on the bottom shelf for \u201cunhangables,\u201d such as garbage bags. For bonus points, pare your collection down to one or two earth-friendly alternatives from <a href=\"http:\/\/generationgreenwpg.com\/\">Generation Green<\/a>.\n<h3>4. Double-duty backsplash<\/h3>\nWhen it comes to organizing your kitchen, don\u2019t let space goes to waste. Lean a square of pegboard against the back wall of your kitchen counter. Simply insert hooks into the board and hang the tools you use most often to keep them handy. This customizable option can be used for measuring cups, spatulas, and even whisks.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_573\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"682\"]<img class=\"wp-image-573 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Hanging Cups, Organizing Kitchen, 300 Main Apartments\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" \/> Photo by Calum Lewis from Unsplash[\/caption]\n<h3>5. Stickin\u2019 your spices<\/h3>\nCooking a meal can feel intimidating when you\u2019re fumbling through your cabinet of toppling jars, bags, and containers of spices. Head to the nearby dollar store to purchase small glass jars and magnets. With a little bit of hot glue, your made-for-the-counter jars can become fridge magnets. Fill them up with your favourite spices for an easy way to grab cinnamon or oregano while minimizing cabinet clutter.\n\nStorage spaces and gadgets don\u2019t need to be used the way they were intended to be; with a bit of imagination, you can make your kitchen a welcoming place to whip up your favourite meals! Feeling inspired to get the rest of your home in shipshape? Gather ideas by browsing <a href=\"http:\/\/hutk.ca\/\">HutK<\/a>\u2019s collection of beautiful furniture that doubles as clever storage.\n<h3><em><strong>What are your favourite ways to make your kitchen an inviting place to cook?<\/strong><\/em><\/h3>",

They are all lovely places to visit alone or with out-of-town guests, but your downtown options don\u2019t end there! Once you've toured these greats, what other cultural gems can you visit? Here are three you may not know about.\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/oseredok.ca\/\">Oseredok<\/a>\u2014A Chance to Witness Some Ukrainian Cultural Heritage<\/h3>\n<img class=\"wp-image-610 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/IMG_3696-2-300x300.png\" alt=\"Outside of Oseredok\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/><img class=\"wp-image-608 aligncenter\" style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/IMG_3680-2-300x300.png\" alt=\"Ukranian couch, Ukranian throw pillows, Ukranian museum\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/>\n\nEveryone in Winnipeg seems to either have Ukrainian heritage or knows somebody who does. Did you know we\u2019ve got our own Ukrainian cultural centre and museum at the edge of downtown? Oseredok has two floors of changing exhibits and a gift shop. The exhibits change every four to six weeks, so you can go back frequently to see new things. During my visit, the second floor held a charming array of quilts, pillows and other stitched items of art.\n\nThe staff members I spoke to were friendly and answered all of my questions. The museum is small, so it\u2019s a great place to go when you want a quick visit. And if you\u2019re trying to save your pennies, good news: visiting Oseredok is free of charge!\n\nThe centre also offers a few public workshops each year, including a chance to learn the art of egg painting at Easter time and how to cook food for Ukrainian Christmas.\n\n<strong><em>If You Go<\/em><\/strong>\n\nOseredok is located at 184 Alexander Avenue East. Admission is free. Current visiting hours are Monday to Saturday, 10 am to 4 pm. You can check out the museum online at <a href=\"http:\/\/oseredok.ca\/\">oseredok.ca<\/a>.\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sportmanitoba.ca\/canada-games-centre\">Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame<\/a><\/h3>\nIf you decide to visit Oseredok, you might as well make it a two-for-one day! The\n\nManitoba Sports Hall of Fame is just steps away, located in the sparkly new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sportmanitoba.ca\/canada-games-centre\">Canada Games Sports for Life Centre<\/a>.\n\nHere, you can see some of Manitoba\u2019s sports history and learn about our greatest athletes and sporting achievements. This is another small museum that\u2019s perfect for an afternoon visit.\n\nThe current exhibit looks at Manitoba sports through the decades, with a focus on athletes who also served in Canada\u2019s military. This exhibit is to honour the 100th anniversary of the end of the Great War. You\u2019ll get the chance to read about our athletes (including Bobby Hull), view a nice array of sports memorabilia, and watch a video or two. The exhibits change about once per year.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-623 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/IMG_3702.png\" alt=\"Sport Manitoba, Sport for Life Centre\" width=\"710\" height=\"994\" \/>\n\n<strong><em>If You Go<\/em><\/strong>\n\nThe museum and the Canada Games Sports Centre for Life are located at 145 Pacific Avenue at the edge of downtown. (Note: there is no entry from Alexander Street)\n\nCurrent visiting hours are:\n\n* Tuesday, Friday and Saturday from 10 am to 4 pm\n* Wednesday and Thursday from 12 pm to 8 pm\n\nAdmission is $5 for adults, $3 for teens and seniors, and just $2 for children 12 and under. You can visit their website at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sportmanitoba.ca\/hall-of-fame\">sportmanitoba.ca\/hall-of-fame<\/a>.\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\/\">Dalnavert Museum<\/a><\/h3>\nMy favourite of the three museums I visited is Dalnavert Museum. It\u2019s a Victorian house built in 1895 that was occupied by one-time Manitoba premier <a href=\"http:\/\/www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\/hugh-john-personal-and-career\/\">Hugh John Macdonald<\/a>, who was also known for his family relations. (His father was Canada\u2019s first prime minister, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.canadahistory.com\/sections\/politics\/pm\/johnmacdonald.htm\">John A. Macdonald<\/a>.) Hugh\u2019s family lived in the home until 1929. It was taken over and turned into a museum in the 1970s.\n\nYou can take guided tours through the building, which shows off Victorian architecture and furnishings. It\u2019s a great spot for history and architecture buffs, and the guides are knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions. (Guided tours take 45 minutes to an hour)<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-637\" src=\"http:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/IMG_3756.png\" alt=\"Dalnavert Museum, Historic Site, Ancient, Classic Interior\" width=\"800\" height=\"571\" \/>\n\nMy favourite reason for visiting Dalnavert is for the events they run throughout the year, especially at Christmas time!\n\nThe museum has done <a href=\"http:\/\/www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\/new-events\/2018\/12\/20\/a-christmas-carol-reading\">readings of A Christmas Carol<\/a> and a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\/new-events\/2017\/12\/15\/its-a-wonderful-life-a-live-radio-play\">radio play version of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life<\/a>. You can enjoy the festivities while nibbling baked treats and imbibing hot cider, mulled wine or hot chocolate. This year, they\u2019re hosting several lecture series covering topics including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\/new-events\/2018\/11\/4\/lecture-series-jane-austen-reading-series\">Jane Austen<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\/new-events\/2018\/12\/16\/charles-dickens-the-man-behind-the-carol\">Charles Dickens<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\/new-events\/2018\/12\/2\/victorian-ghost-stories\">Victorian ghosts<\/a>. I attended a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\/new-events\/2016\/12\/12\/clue-at-the-museum\">Clue<\/a> board game night there last year, which featured talented actors playing out the murder scene in different rooms of the mansion!\n\n<em><strong>If You Go<\/strong><\/em>\n\nDalnavert is located at 61 Carlton Street (south of Broadway). Winter visiting hours are Wednesday to Sunday, 12 pm to 4 pm. The hours change throughout the year, so check their website before you go. Admission is $6 for adults, $5 for students and seniors, and\n\n$4 for children. To find out what intriguing events they have coming up next, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\">friendsofdalnavert.ca<\/a>\n\nImportant note: because they haven\u2019t changed the original structure of the building, the second and third floors are not wheelchair accessible.\n<h4><strong>These Aren\u2019t The Only Museums Downtown!<\/strong><\/h4>\nOseredok, the Sports Hall of Fame and Dalnavert are just three of downtown Winnipeg\u2019s lesser-known museums. There are others you can visit, such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wpgrailwaymuseum.com\/home.html\">Winnipeg Railway Museum<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/winnipeg.ca\/police\/Museum\/default.stm\">Winnipeg Police Museum<\/a>.\n\nWinnipeg is so full of history, we pass by so many of these cultural gems each day without giving them a second glance. If you want to enjoy everything your downtown home has to offer, make sure to visit them!\n<h4><em>Is your personal favourite missing from this list?

Located in Peg Beer Co.\u2019s previous location behind the <a href=\"https:\/\/centennialconcerthall.com\/Online\/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall<\/a>, Nonsuch had a soft opening during <a href=\"http:\/\/nuitblanchewinnipeg.ca\/\">Nuit Blanche<\/a>, exhibiting dozens of golden umbrellas on its ceiling, illuminated by just as many light bulbs. The room is tastefully decorated with black walls, so-comfy-you-sink-in-them sofas, and modern furniture. The vibe is very relaxed, perfect for both groups and couples.\n\nEverything on their menu is $7: every beer, ranging from a Belgian blonde to a Baltic porter, is $7 (those with a higher ABV are served in slightly smaller quantity). Nosh on a delicious fruit and nut plate or dig into a massive bowl of popcorn with your choice of dill, chilli pepper, or truffle seasoning. The fantastic beer, relaxed atmosphere, and stellar service are sure to make Nonsuch Brewing Co. your new go-to bar\u2014it\u2019s definitely mine!\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forth.ca\">Forth Cocktail Bar<\/a><\/h3>\n171 McDermot Ave\nTuesday to Thursday, 4 pm to 1 am\nFriday to Saturday, 4 pm to 2 am\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.forth.ca\">forth.ca<\/a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2033\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"940\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bfd_oG9nvQf\/\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2033\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/by-travis_ross-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Bartender, Forth, People, Talking\" width=\"940\" height=\"626\" \/><\/a> ? by @travis_ross on @forth_wpg Instagram[\/caption]\n\nIf you live or work downtown, chances are you\u2019ve been to Forth for a coffee and a quick bite, or even to their tiny rooftop bar in the summer. But at night, through a separate entrance that leads to the basement, Forth Cocktail Bar comes alive in a speakeasy-style space below the caf\u00e9. The bar offers light bites, wine and beer, premium spirits (like mezcal and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/c\/35\/japanese-whisky\">Japanese whisky<\/a>), and great cocktails. The bartenders are also highly knowledgeable, so they encourage guests to let go of the reins and try something new by ordering the \u201cBartender\u2019s Choice.\u201d The space of this speakeasy is dark and cosy, making it a great spot for a late night cocktail.\n\nMake sure to head to Forth Cocktail Bar on a Friday night for their weekly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forth.ca\/events\/2018\/7\/27\/forth-fridays\">Forth Fridays<\/a> event, where one of their resident DJs will be spinning their playlist from 10 pm until late.\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/amsterdamtearoom.com\">Amsterdam Tea Room<\/a><\/h3>\n103-211 Bannatyne Ave\nTuesday to Saturday, 10 am to 12 am\n<a href=\"http:\/\/amsterdamtearoom.com\">amsterdamtearoom.com<\/a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2050\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"940\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BiFovi-nyKy\/\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2050\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/by-amsterdamtearoomandbar-1024x648.jpg\" alt=\"Watching the Jets, Winnipeg Jets, People Drinking\" width=\"940\" height=\"595\" \/><\/a> ? by @amsterdamtearoomandbar on Instagram[\/caption]\n\nThe absolute best spot for a boozy hot drink during the cold months. Not only does Amsterdam Tea Room offer a food menu specializing in Dutch delicacies (traditional bites, sandwiches, desserts, and more) and a selection of teas to rival <a href=\"https:\/\/www.davidstea.com\/ca_en\/home\/\">David\u2019s Tea<\/a> (including their own in-house blends), but they also have a fantastic cocktail list.\n\nYou can have a hot boozy tea, made with tea-infused spirits (like earl grey gin, jasmine vodka and Scottish breakfast rum), or a refreshing tea cocktail. The cocktails are perfectly balanced, and you might be surprised to find matcha mixed with vodka or mint green tea shaken with bourbon. Co-owner Mark will be sure to make you feel at home and recommend the best brew for you. You might walk out of there with a bag of tea as well as a warmed belly!\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/cordovatapas.bar\">Cordova Tapas &amp; Wine<\/a><\/h3>\n93 Albert St\nTuesday to Thursday, 8 am to 2:30 pm; 4:30 pm to 12 am\nFriday, 8 am to 2:30 pm; 4:30 pm to 2 am\nSaturday, 5 pm to 2 am\n<a href=\"https:\/\/cordovatapas.bar\">cordovatapas.bar<\/a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2051\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"940\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BZ1zgmjncR8\/\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2051\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/by-cordovatapas-1024x767.jpg\" alt=\"Cordova Tapas &amp; Wine, Celebrating, People, Hanging Out, Having Fun, Drinking\" width=\"940\" height=\"704\" \/><\/a> ? by @cordovatapas on Instagram[\/caption]\n\nMy favourite beer in the entire world (to date) is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/180\/1421\/\">Delirium Nocturnum<\/a>, a Belgian beer, but it\u2019s very hard to find. If an establishment has Delirium at all, it\u2019s almost always <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ratebeer.com\/beer\/delirium-tremens\/1039\/\">Delirium Tremens<\/a>. Which is why I was so happy to see that in addition to tapas and wine, Cordova also specializes in Belgian beers\u2014complete with the Delirium sign hanging above the bar! My ecstasy at finding Delirium Nocturnum in Winnipeg aside, Cordova is also a fabulous spot for a nightcap.\n\nThey have an extensive wine selection, carefully crafted cocktails, and delicious tapas. The candlelit atmosphere makes Cordova the perfect spot for an intimate nightcap over a bottle of wine and shared small plates, and it\u2019s a must-stop for any Belgian beer aficionado.\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/smithrestaurant.ca\">Smith<\/a><\/h3>\n75 Forks Market Rd\nMonday to Thursday, 6:30 am to 11 pm\nFriday to Saturday, 6:30 am to 12 am\nSunday, 7 am to 11 pm\n<a href=\"https:\/\/smithrestaurant.ca\">smithrestaurant.ca<\/a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2056\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"940\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BREdkWXhwJV\/\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2056\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/by-smithwinnipeg-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Winnipeg, Smith Restaurant, Hang out place, Cozy, Lounge\" width=\"940\" height=\"610\" \/><\/a> ? by @smithwinnipeg on Instagram[\/caption]\n\nI realized a few years ago that hotel bars are extremely underrated. They\u2019re usually quiet, relaxed, open late, and offer a great selection of food and drinks and amazing service. Hotel bars just aren\u2019t the first place most people think about when they want to get a drink somewhere! But you don\u2019t need to be a hotel guest to enjoy the hotel bar.\n\nMy favourite hotel bar in the city, and one I\u2019ve been going to for years, is Smith at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.innforks.com\/\">Inn at the Forks<\/a>. The food is phenomenal, and if you\u2019re not up for a meal, they have a large selection of small plates and sides. (My friends and I usually order a bunch of sides to share.) They have great local beers on tap that rotate regularly, a fantastic wine selection, and some seriously good cocktails. Like, seriously good (try the mezcal and beet cocktail). They have a list of classic cocktails and a list of Smith originals. They even have their own gin! Not to mention the d\u00e9cor is sleek and cosy, and no one is going to bug you if you stay in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebay.com\/\">Hudson\u2019s Bay<\/a> blanket booth for hours.\n<h4>So on a cold Winnipeg night, after the Jets have once again made their city proud and you\u2019re craving a nightcap to finish off your evening, try something new! Think of a crisp, locally-brewed beer, a cosy speakeasy, a warm tea cocktail, a juicy glass of wine, and delicious late-night food made by some of Winnipeg\u2019s best kitchens. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com\/\">Downtown Winnipeg<\/a> has a lot to offer if you know where to look\u2026<\/h4>\nHave you had a tantalizing nightcap at any of Elena\u2019s favourite spots? Let us know what you recommend!",

		"content": "Between your 9-5 job, Tuesday Yoga classes and drinks with that online date, plant upkeep is at the back of your mind. However, your apartment isn\u2019t just a place to crash\u2014it's your home. And every home feels livelier and friendlier with a little greenery. If you don\u2019t consider yourself a Green Thumb, don\u2019t be intimidated\u2014there are voluminous solutions even for the serial plant killers out there!\n\nHere are just a few ways to bring the beauty of nature into your living space with this selection of some of the finest and easiest plants for your high-rise apartment at 300 Main.\n<h3>Cacti<\/h3>\nIf you love variety, cacti are the way to go. Cacti are available in all sorts and in an abundance of shapes and sizes, making them the perfect plant to help your apartment look \u201csharp.\u201d\n\nThe upkeep of cacti is as simple as it gets. These easy-to-care-for plants can endure the desert, so if you have a window available, it is more than likely your apartment will be an equally equipped environment to provide these plants with everything they need to thrive. These prickly fellas only need to be watered weekly and need at least four to five hours of direct sunlight a day. Placing them on a window sill will ensure their proper growth\u2014and you\u2019re out of the prick zone!\n<h6><em>Quick Tip:<\/em><\/h6>\nDuring our sub-zero months here in Winnipeg, take care not to place your cacti right up against a window. Choose a higher table or stand by a window to ensure your cacti are still receiving sunlight but able to bask in your heated apartment.\n<h3>Succulents<\/h3>\nSucculents are resilient, low maintenance, and come in a variety of structures and colors, making them ideal candidates for your own planted arrangement! While succulents do enjoy light, think of them as small children at the beach: Watch that they\u2019re not in direct sunlight for long periods of time (for example, on a window sill). Contrary to common belief, these colorful beings do not thrive when met with scorching temperatures and full-on sun exposure. Succulents need a deep watering once a week during their active growth period, but do not mistake this for drowning the vibrant plant.\n\nIndoor succulent pots do not require a drainage hole because they should never be watered so much that water leaks from the base. This attribute makes them the perfect plants to put in a hanging pot. You can let their greenery reach the highest of corners of your apartment for an aesthetically pleasing display; or consider showcasing your succulents in a terrarium. A terrarium is a fun addition to your apartment d\u00e9cor.\n<h3>Mint Plants<\/h3>\nYou don\u2019t need your own garden to harvest herb\u2014mint plants flourish indoors. Place these minty seedlings on a window sill in your kitchen (or a window sill of your preference) and water them\n\nfour times a week. This may seem like a hassle, but once a mint leaf has fully blossomed, you can snip it off and throw it into your tea or add some fresh flavour to an old recipe.\n<h3>Basil Plants<\/h3>\nLike mint, basil plants grow well indoors. Plop them next to your mint plants on the window sill, water every three to four days, and you\u2019ve got your own herb garden in the making. Just like mint, basil leaves are a great resource to have in your kitchen. Chop fresh basil into your sauces or sprinkle onto your homemade pizzas. A little bit of basil tastes great in soups and stews, too.\n<h6><em>Quick Tip for Mint and Basil Plants:<\/em><\/h6>\nYou can purchase fully-grown mint and basil plants at any local garden centre, or you can buy the seeds and grow them yourself. For the latter option, be prepared to wait two weeks before you see growth above the soil line. When you do see your own little plants popping up, the waiting will pay off!\n<h3>Aloe Vera<\/h3>\nIf you\u2019re looking for a plant with function, look no further than aloe. It may be an odd-looking plant, but it provides a useful balm that is handy for sunburns and scrapes. Of additional value, aloe helps purify your stuffy apartment air.\n\nIt thrives in moist soil, so be sure to water it regularly and give it plenty of bright, indirect light.\n<h3>Bamboo Plants<\/h3>\nIf the spaces near your windows are becoming crowded, consider a bamboo branch. Bamboo plants only need water and shade to survive, making them ideal houseplants for hallways, corners of rooms or areas that lack sunlight at all hours of the day.\n\nIf your newly purchased bamboo plant is at the initial phases of its growth, water the young plant twice a week for the first six months. For an aged bamboo plant, watering every seven to ten days will be enough to keep your bamboo nourished and healthy.\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2518 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Indoor Plant, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Plants\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>Fiddle-leaf Fig Trees<\/h3>\nThe upkeep of a fiddle-leaf fig tree is a bit trickier, but not so much that you shouldn\u2019t enjoy its essence in your home. A fig tree is not unlike an angst-filled teenager: Give it space when needed!\n\nPlace a fiddle-leaf fig tree at least five feet away from a window. This should be a space in your apartment where sun rays will hit it, but not constantly throughout the day. The watering routine will depend on the moistness of the soil. Touch the soil and if it is still wet from its last watering five days ago, leave it alone. The tree only needs to be watered when the top few inches of the soil are dry; then it\u2019s time to give your plant a drink.\n<h6><em>Quick tip:<\/em><\/h6>\nJust like teenagers, fiddle-leaf fig trees have growth spurts. If you purchase the fig tree when it is just budding, expect rapid growth in the beginning. Fiddle-leaf fig trees grow as tall as six feet, but in most cases, the plant tops at four feet while indoors. If you have low ceilings in your apartment, you can trim the leaves to accompany your space.\n<h3>Anthurium<\/h3>\nIf you are looking to add a pop of colour in your space, anthurium is the perfect indoor flower for apartment living. This flower can tolerate all types of light but will grow best with bright, indirect light. If you have a window with a constructed view of the sun or a surface close enough to a source of light, these are ideal locations for anthurium.\n<h3>Enjoy your Urban Jungle!<\/h3>\nIndoor pants help transform a space into a home. Adding plants is literally adding life to your home! Being intentional about bringing nature into your space will make your downtown apartment an oasis of rest from the hustle and bustle of urban living.",

He would be on time for his career counselling session at <a href=\"https:\/\/manitobastart.com\/\">Manitoba Start<\/a>, just a few blocks away. This was his first session, and he breathed an inward sigh of relief that such a great resource was so close to his apartment building. He had just arrived last week and was eager to get settled. Securing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.mb.ca\/health\/mhsip\/mbcard.html\">Manitoba Health Card<\/a> and finding a family doctor had been fairly easy. He had even been able to use the free services of the <a href=\"https:\/\/winnipegtransit.com\/service\/downtownspirit\/\">Downtown Spirit<\/a> bus since everything was within a few blocks of his new apartment in downtown.\n\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BhrT9cyHBbK\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BhrT9cyHBbK\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Downtown Winnipeg BIZ (@downtownwpgbiz)<\/a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-04-17T15:34:01+00:00\">Apr 17, 2018 at 8:34am PDT<\/time><\/p>\n\n<\/div><\/blockquote>\n<\/center>\n\nAs he walked to his destination, Henry cast a cursory glance around him. He was amazed at the diversity; people of all ethnicities and ages walked past him, in harmony with each other yet comfortably oblivious to their own surroundings. He noticed people rushing to work, too rushed to drink their coffee yet taking the time to hold open doors for others. He was falling in love with his new home! He felt a sense of belonging and was already looking forward to the weekend. He had seen posters for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.manyfest.ca\/\">ManyFest<\/a> and was excited to be living a short walk from where all the action would be. As he rushed across the cross walk, he thought about his plans for the coming weekend: the festival, a visit to the <a href=\"https:\/\/wpl.winnipeg.ca\/library\/\">public library<\/a> to check out their collection and perhaps some Indian cuisine at a nearby restaurant. He realized he was talking to himself as he entered the the <a href=\"https:\/\/downtownwinnipegbiz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/downtown_winnipeg_indoor_walkway_map_2013.pdf\">Downtown Winnipeg Indoor Walkway (lovingly known as the skywalk by locals)<\/a>\u00a0to escape the gust of wind that threatened to sweep away the documents that he had been carrying. He shook his head, smiling. He couldn\u2019t wait to get back to his apartment to finish settling in. His days now began with sipping his morning tea while waiting for the sun to light up the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.mb.ca\/legislature\/visiting\/docs\/goldenboy_factsheet.pdf\">Golden Boy<\/a> as it serenely overlooked downtown. For the tenth time that day, he made a mental note to thank the friend who had suggested he find a place downtown to start his new life in Winnipeg.\n\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BrMdU1xga5f\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BrMdU1xga5f\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Heather\u2019s iPhotos (@heathers.iphotos)<\/a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-10T05:13:20+00:00\">Dec 9, 2018 at 9:13pm PST<\/time><\/p>\n\n<\/div><\/blockquote>\n<\/center>\n\nStarting a new life in an unfamiliar city can be unnerving. Resources are limited, expectations are high and there is always too much to do. That\u2019s why it is important to choose a location that can help you get things done on the fast track. Living at the heart of the city and near all the major institutions not only saves precious time, but also gives the added advantage of being mobile even if you\u2019re not ready to own a vehicle. It\u2019s cost-effective to be able to walk to most places which is exactly what you\u2019re looking for when starting your life in a new city. Better to burn calories than cents when you\u2019re relying on your savings!\n\nDowntown Winnipeg is also a great place to network, which is invaluable when you\u2019re adjusting to a new culture and looking for a job in your field. You need to be at the right place at the right time. Fortunately, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/employment-social-development\/corporate\/portfolio\/service-canada.html\">Service Canada<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/portageplace.ca\/\">Portage Place<\/a> offers free resources for job seekers. If you need to focus, search for a job and print a few resumes, make use of their free computer and printing services.\n\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bdm6jzJA_3Y\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bdm6jzJA_3Y\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by @simplicityshots<\/a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-01-06T12:29:31+00:00\">Jan 6, 2018 at 4:29am PST<\/time><\/p><\/div><\/blockquote><\/center>\n<script async src=\"\/\/www.instagram.com\/embed.js\"><\/script>\nAnd in case you\u2019re wondering, downtown Winnipeg is definitely not an \u201call work and no play\u201d kind of place. Looking to relax after a long working week? That\u2019s the beauty of downtown: it\u2019s home to a lot of tourist attractions and entertainment spots. Whether it\u2019s a stroll through the beautiful grounds at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theforks.com\/\">The Forks<\/a> or a <a href=\"http:\/\/downtownwinnipegbiz.com\/programs-services\/events\/movies-on-memorial\/\">movie in Memorial Park<\/a>, everything is within reach. If you need to use <a href=\"https:\/\/winnipegtransit.com\/en\">Winnipeg Transit<\/a>, most major bus routes run right through downtown, making it easy to get around! There are convenient options for grocery shopping, and a plethora of ethnic stores makes for a diverse retail environment that caters to a multicultural community.\n\nAnd downtown Winnipeg is exceptionally multicultural. You\u2019ll see Diwali celebrations happening amidst decorations waiting for the Christmas season to gain momentum, and people rushing for Eid prayers right after Easter wraps up. There is something for everyone here: the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wag.ca\/\">Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG)<\/a> for the art enthusiast who wants to analyse each piece, free yoga classes in Memorial Park for the fitness freak, and tons of delectable dining options for the foodie. And in case you\u2019re all three, everything is always only a few blocks away! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com\/\">The Downtown Winnipeg Biz<\/a> is a great resource for finding ways to experience the best Winnipeg has to offer.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about starting a new chapter of your life in Winnipeg, look no further than downtown\u2014and I mean literally! Be where the government services are, where the action is and where breakfast meets business.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to Winnipeg or considering relocating, what else would you like to know?

In December, I left the comfort of my warm couch to venture out for the last <a href=\"https:\/\/www.firstfridayswinnipeg.org\/\">First Fridays<\/a> of 2018.\n\nI met up with a friend at 7 pm and started my night with a warm beverage and a snack at the <a href=\"http:\/\/amsterdamtearoom.com\/\">Amsterdam Tea Room<\/a> (211 Bannatyne Avenue). Their recently-launched <a href=\"http:\/\/amsterdamtearoom.com\/dinner-menu\/\">new menu<\/a> had popped up in several of my friends\u2019 Instagram stories, and I was eager to try it myself. The last time I\u2019d been there, it was a quaint little tea room; it\u2019s since transformed into a busy, hip tea bar. We grabbed seats at the bar and I ordered a hot toddy and a small plate with crispy fingerling potatoes, charred onion, cucumber, celery, ketchup aioli, mustard seeds, sesame, and pecorino cheese. The server told me that if I took a little bit of all the components of the dish in one big bite, it would taste like a Big Mac\u2014yum!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2564\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"940\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2564 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IMG_5710-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Derek McCandless, Live Music, Amsterdam Tea Room, Exchange District, First Fridays in the Exchange, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" \/> Winnipeg Folk Fest performer, Derek McCandless performing at Amsterdam Tea Room on First Fridays in the Exchange on December 7, 2018. Photo credits to the author[\/caption]\n\nLive music from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.derrickmccandless.com\/\">Derek McCandless<\/a> gave us a \u201cFolk Fix\u201d to get the evening started while we enjoyed our drinks. The bar was buzzing with people, the chatter blending seamlessly into his soothing voice and guitar notes. We made a game plan and left with our bellies full, ready to take on the night.\n\nOur next stop was at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.graffitigallery.ca\/\">Graffiti Gallery<\/a> (109 Higgins Avenue) for the opening reception of WOMAN GOOD BAD BAD: a series of all-new work by Winnipeg artist <a href=\"https:\/\/gabriellewmfunk.com\/\">Gabrielle Funk<\/a>. The gallery floor was deliciously pink, and I fell in love instantly. Abstract pastel graphics on the walls seemed to blend in with the artwork. I later learned that the gallery is modified before every exhibition to match the artwork and create a cohesive experience.\n\nPeople milled about the gallery with wine glasses and kombucha bottles, bobbing their heads to music from the DJ in the corner. There were free appetizers and a cash bar, and the artwork itself was beautiful. Most of the paintings were based on friends and family members of the artist, and the faces look extremely realistic yet surreal. Through this show, Funk explores the duality of the conventional representation of women in religion, art, and the media.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2566\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2566\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Tara Davis Studio Boutique, First Fridays in the Exchange, Exchange District, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"750\" \/> A collection of painting by artist, Joshua Wilson at tara davis studio boutique.

The exhibit was called \u201c12\u201d\u2014the 7th annual exhibition of 12 local artists showing 12 small works no larger than 12x12\u201d. One of the collections that caught my attention was by Joshua Wilson, an artist who paints quirky pictures of animals with cigarettes. I really wanted to take home a painting of a crab with a cigarette, but I settled for a pair of mismatched purple socks with cacti on them.\n\nMy friend and I parted ways, and I walked over to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.winnipegfilmgroup.com\/cinematheque\/\">Cinematheque<\/a> (304-100 Arthur Street) for my last stop of the night: a screening of <em><a href=\"https:\/\/streamingmoviesright.com\/us\/movie\/sorry-to-bother-you\">SORRY TO BOTHER YOU<\/a><\/em>, presented by Black Space Winnipeg. I was a little wary of going to this with just my popcorn for company, but in Winnipeg, six degrees of separation is a very real thing. I ran into friends from work and someone I went to school with, so I joined them for the movie.\n\nCinematheque is one of those old-school movie theaters that brings back the romance of movie watching. The architecture of the <a href=\"https:\/\/art-space.ca\/artspace-building\/\">ArtSpace<\/a> building is stunning and the theatres are small and intimate. Before heading into the showing, I stopped at the bar for a glass of wine to go with my popcorn.\n\nThe movie started a little late, but no one seemed to mind. Written and directed by Boots Riley and starring <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm3147751\/\">Lakeith Stanfield<\/a>, Sorry to Bother You is a dystopian comedy that addresses societal issues like racism and commercialism. (The ending will leave you feeling unsettled in the best way possible.) It\u2019s both thoughtful and hilarious, with tremendous actors.\n\nIt was almost midnight by the time the movie ended. Over at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetallestpoppy.com\/\">The Tallest Poppy<\/a> (103 Sherbrook Street), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.synonymartconsultation.com\/\">Synonym<\/a>\u2019s First Friday After Party would be just starting to heat up. But after a full evening of soaking up culture and art, I was ready to head back home.\n\nBy midnight, I had only managed to fit in four of the 36 great events happening that night. I hope to go back this week to catch some of the venues I missed. To stay up to date on all the amazing things happening on First Fridays in the Exchange, check out their website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.firstfridayswinnipeg.org\/\">firstfridayswinnipeg.org<\/a> a few days before the monthly event.\n\n<em>Have you explored First Fridays yet?<\/em>",

		"content": "Now that 2018 has wrapped up, you might be wondering what\u2019s happening soon in the downtown \u2018Peg. The area is bustling with development, including <a href=\"https:\/\/300main.ca\/\">300 Main<\/a>, and 2019 is already shaping up to be jam-packed with events. Here\u2019s a look at some of the great happenings you\u2019ll want to jot down in your calendar.\n<h3>Do You Like Music?<\/h3>\nThere will be concerts galore\u2014including headliners from multiple decades\u2014at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bellmtsplace.ca\/\">Bell MTS Place<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/tlcketmaster-ca.com\/results-ticket?evtid=3802297&amp;event=Justin+Timberlake\">Justin Timberlake<\/a> will be the major draw in February. April sees the legendary <a href=\"https:\/\/tlcketmaster-ca.com\/results-ticket?evtid=3824243&amp;event=Fleetwood+Mac\">Fleetwood Mac<\/a> come to town on the 11th, while Canadian rockers <a href=\"https:\/\/tlcketmaster-ca.com\/results-ticket?evtid=3823211&amp;event=Metric\">Metric<\/a> play on the 23rd. Country sensation <a href=\"https:\/\/tlcketmaster-ca.com\/results-ticket?evtid=3659325&amp;event=Carrie+Underwood%2C+Maddie+and+Tae+%26+Runaway+June\">Carrie Underwood<\/a> comes through on June 2nd. And taking you back to the 1980s is <a href=\"https:\/\/tlcketmaster-ca.com\/results-ticket?evtid=3811949&amp;event=Corey+Hart\">Corey Hart<\/a> on June 18th. If you go, report back on whether he still wears his sunglasses at night. (Sorry. Had to.) To see a full list of events, check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bellmtsplace.ca\/calendar\/\">Bell MTS Place events calendar<\/a>.\n<h3>Looking for Some Culture?<\/h3>\nThe ballet, opera and symphony all operate out of the <a href=\"https:\/\/centennialconcerthall.com\/Online\/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall<\/a>, and with the <a href=\"https:\/\/royalmtc.ca\/\">Royal Manitoba Theatre Company<\/a> (Royal MTC) around the corner, there is always something new to watch downtown. The <a href=\"https:\/\/buy.rwb.org\/single\/EventListing.aspx\">Royal Winnipeg Ballet<\/a> (RWB) performs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rwb.org\/whats-on\/show\/romeo-juliet\/\">Romeo &amp; Juliet<\/a> February 13th through 17th. I\u2019ve seen this one before and can vouch for the gorgeous costumes and delightful choreography. If you\u2019re looking for a show that will entrance young kids, the RWB will perform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rwb.org\/whats-on\/show\/the-wizard-of-oz\/\">The Wizard of Oz<\/a> from May 1st to 5th.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/mbopera.ca\/season\/the-barber-of-seville\/\">Manitoba Opera<\/a> is putting on one of my favourite operas this spring, The Barber of Seville. This one\u2019s a comedy, so don\u2019t expect a long dirge. When you hear \u201cFigaro, Figaro, Fiiiigaro!\u201d being belted out onstage, you might recognize the famous aria featured in the Looney Tunes \u201cRabbit of Seville.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/tickets.mbopera.ca\/TheatreManager\/1\/login?event=281\">The Barber of Seville<\/a> runs April 6th, 9th and 12th.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/royalmtc.ca\/Current-Plays\/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2605 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg\" alt=\"Roald Dahl\u2019s Matilda The Musical, Musical, Theatre, Show, Downtown Winnipeg, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Royal MTC), Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"322\" \/><\/a><\/p>\nFor <a href=\"https:\/\/royalmtc.ca\/Tickets.aspx\">Royal MTC<\/a> fans, you can catch <a href=\"https:\/\/royalmtc.ca\/Current-Plays\/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\">Matilda the Musical<\/a> (based on the Roald Dahl Book) from January 8th to February 2nd . Another option is <a href=\"http:\/\/royalmtc.ca\/Current-Plays\/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">A Doll\u2019s House<\/a> from January 30st to February 16th. I\u2019ve never heard of this one, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/royalmtc.ca\/Current-Plays\/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">description<\/a> sounds intriguing: \u201cHenrik Ibsen\u2019s realist masterpiece resonates more than a century after the debut of Nora Helmer, whose bourgeois illusions are shattered by the realization that she\u2019s merely a doll in her own home.\u201d\n\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/wso.ca\/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO)<\/a> has events for all tastes throughout the year. The one I find most intriguing <a href=\"https:\/\/wso.ca\/1819season\/\">this season<\/a> is <a href=\"https:\/\/wso.ca\/star-wars-star-trek\/\">Star Wars vs. Star Trek<\/a>, running February 22nd to 24th. According to the WSO, \u201cSpecial guest hosts Brett Megarry and Jeff Braun, from <a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/winnipeg\/program\/couch-potatoes-cjob\">CJOB\u2019s The Couch Potatoes<\/a>, settle the score with iconic music from both a galaxy far, far away and where no man has gone before.\u201d\n\nAnd my last theatre recommendation is the smash musical <a href=\"https:\/\/centennialconcerthall.com\/Online\/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=KinkyBoots&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=\">Kinky Boots<\/a>. The Centennial Concert Hall\u2019s got this one from April 16th through 21st. I\u2019ve only seen the movie version of this, and it was great. Expect the musical to be even better.\n<h3>Want to Stay Warm and Burn Some Calories?<\/h3>\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Br8PXxYjmJn\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0px; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0px auto 12px; width: 50px; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0px; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0px 7px; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Br8PXxYjmJn\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by The Forks (@theforkswinnipeg)<\/a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-28T18:34:57+00:00\">Dec 28, 2018 at 10:34am PST<\/time><\/p>\n\n<\/div><\/blockquote><\/center>\n<script async src=\"\/\/www.instagram.com\/embed.js\"><\/script>\n\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theforks.com\/events\/red-river-mutual-trail\">Red River Mutual Trail<\/a> should be open again soon (once we get some colder weather).

		"content": "While most of us love the idea of having our own space to do exactly what we want in, the reality is that living alone can be expensive. It can also be lonely, so some of us choose to have roommates for companionship. Whatever your reasons might be, living with roommates can be a lovely\u2014or disastrous\u2014experience.\n<h3>The Good<\/h3>\nSplitting living costs means you have more money for other things. You can also create great memories with roommates. I\u2019ve had roomies off and on in my life, particularly in my university years. One of my favourite aspects of living with others is the meshing of traditions and cultures around the holidays. One year, three of us celebrated Christmas and two celebrated Hanukkah. We decided to mash everything together and made a Chrismukkah tree. It was a traditional Christmas evergreen tree, but we covered it in blue and silver decorations (the colours of Hannukah) and used a big Star of David as a tree topper. It was fun watching the roomies who\u2019d never had a tree try to figure out how to hang balls and baubles, as those little squeezable hooks aren\u2019t really used for anything but Christmas decorations. We also got to teach our roommates all of the lyrics to cheesy Christmas songs. And later that school year, I learned how to celebrate Passover. We always enjoyed our combined holiday events.\n\nBeing students, we had lots of silly drunken nights and sometimes came up with imaginative solutions to our problems. We had been given a TV by one set of parents, but it had no remote control. We were entirely too lazy to get up and change the channel, so one night we found some duct tape and taped all of our wooden spoons and spatulas together in a long line that reached from the couch to the TV. It served as a handy, and remarkably sturdy, remote control for the rest of the year.\n\nAnd having roommates means there is often someone there to talk to and do things with without having to schedule plans days in advance, which is a nice bonus.\n<h3>The Bad<\/h3>\nHaving roomies isn\u2019t always idyllic. Living with others is often fraught with annoyances and drama. One of the most common fights is over cleanliness, or lack thereof. I\u2019m sure our bathrooms were teeming with germs, as no one ever wanted to clean them. We had the same problem with dishes. No one ever believed it was their turn to wash, so the dishes just piled up in the sink in ever-teetering towers.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2955\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2955\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png\" alt=\"dirty dishes, dirty kitchen, messy kitchen. apartment living, living with roommates, roomies, winnipeg apartments, 300 Main apartments, downtown winnipeg\" width=\"900\" height=\"612\" \/> ? by rawpixel on Unsplash[\/caption]\n\nYour best bet to avoid similar problems is to have a conversation with your roomies right at the start, to decide what is and isn\u2019t acceptable for everyone. You may also want to create a chore schedule so everyone knows exactly who will be doing what and by when.\n\nAnother issue can be sharing food or other resources. You should decide right away if you are sharing food or keeping things completely separate. This does not guarantee success, by the way. We had one roommate in university (I\u2019m calling her Jane to protect the guilty) who never bought her own food and pilfered from everyone else when we weren\u2019t around. It wasn\u2019t something we were able to successfully stop, and it was one of the reasons she ended up moving out before the year was up.\n<h3>The Ugly<\/h3>\nSome problems grow from small to breathtakingly bad. We had one roommate (surprisingly, not Jane) come back from summer break in second year with a large package in tow. She worked on her parents\u2019 travelling carnival every summer. That year, she had fallen for a 6\u20198\u201d carny and decided to bring him back to university with her. He was supposed to stay a few days, maybe a week or two, before finding his own place. He never left. He spent the entire year living with us, moving from job to job, and never contributed anything towards rent or utilities. It was an ongoing fight all year to get him to pay up or move out, but we didn\u2019t get the big mooch to leave until we all moved out at the end of the school year.\n\nMost roommate situations don\u2019t turn out this badly, but it\u2019s important to know something about the person you are living with and to set clear ground rules from the start. It\u2019s no fun if you suddenly find yourself in need of a new living situation because things have become untenable at home.\n<h3>And the Downright Weird<\/h3>\nSome roommate situations just become weird. Like Jane, who had a revolving door of friends constantly in our apartment. It\u2019s a little disconcerting to walk into your bathroom at 7 am and find some guy you\u2019ve never met before passed out over your toilet. (Hello, awkward conversation.)\n\nIn our student apartment building, people regularly set off the fire alarm with burned popcorn and toast. But when Jane decided it would be a great idea to butt a cigarette into a wastebasket full of paper, the ensuing full-fledged fire didn\u2019t set off the alarms until our apartment was fully consumed by smoke. Most of the damage was contained to her room, but the entire apartment had a distinctly smoky smell for weeks after. I guess my tip here is to choose your roommates wisely.\n<h3>Bottom Line<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_2957\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2957\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky notes, delegating, tasks, communication, assertive, apartment living, downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Apartments\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\" \/> ? by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash[\/caption]\n\nThere are benefits and drawbacks both to living alone and with others. You need to pick the option that best works for you. If you have roommates, spend a little time making the right choice or you could spend a lot of time regretting it. Set clear ground rules and expectations, and be prepared to have frank discussions when things don\u2019t run smoothly. This happens sometimes, even with great roommates. And if you have some bad experiences, remind yourself they make great fodder for party stories later. (And share them below!)",

		"content": "Having a dog while living downtown is a great motivator to get outside, see other people, and experience small daily bits of fun. Walking your dog in the downtown helps you feel like you\u2019re instantly part of a community of dog owners. Dogs are great companions; they\u2019re your best friend, and keep you warm on a cold winter night. On a bad day, a doggie tail wiggle will definitely cheer you up.\n\nSome people say that having a dog is like having a child. I would say it\u2019s like having a child that <em>never grows up<\/em>. But as dog lovers know, they\u2019re worth the work! Having a dog while living in an apartment can actually help you stay motivated to get outside. Dogs need exercise, and can develop health problems if they don\u2019t get enough. No one wants their furry friend to get sick!\n\nSo no matter how snowy, cold, rainy, or hot it is outside, you put a leash on your excited dog and get yourself outside. Sometimes it\u2019s eye-wateringly early and you\u2019re dreaming about your warm bed, but Fido needs his walk. And as a bonus, you get to enjoy as much fresh air and physical activity as your pet! (Ever notice how fit some dog owners are?)\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: Your dog is all excited about going out to see the big world, but you have no idea where to go or what route to take this time. You\u2019re in luck: here\u2019s a list of 5 beautiful places and parks in Winnipeg within a 20-minute walk of 300 Main Street:\n\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BrTa1dpAcvV\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BrTa1dpAcvV\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by David Metcalfe (@davidmetclfe)<\/a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-12T22:06:15+00:00\">Dec 12, 2018 at 2:06pm PST<\/time><\/p>\n\n<\/div><\/blockquote><\/center>\n<script async src=\"\/\/www.instagram.com\/embed.js\"><\/script>\n\n<strong>1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.winnipeg.ca\/PublicWorks\/parksOpenSpace\/OffLeashDogParks\/DTDogPark.stm\">Bonnycastle Dog Park<\/a><\/strong>. The park is just a 12-minute walk from 300 Main Street. It\u2019s located in the beautiful Assiniboine Avenue area, right across from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fortgarryhotel.com\/\">Fort Garry Hotel<\/a>. I love spending summer days here, just walking around and seeing happy dog owners playing with their pets! The park even has a bottle-refill fountain that operates in the hot summer months. Bonnycastle Park was opened in February 2016 and has become very popular with downtown doggies. The off-leash park is fully fenced and has almost 13,000 square feet of playing area. Its design includes artificial turf that was specifically designed for dog parks. Take your dog to Bonnycastle dog park\u2014I promise you both will enjoy it!\n\n<strong>2.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theforks.com\/\"> The Forks<\/a>.<\/strong> You can\u2019t let your dog go off-leash in this heritage area, but why not combine your dog walk with some entertainment for yourself? The Forks is just a 9-minute walk away from 300 Main Street. In the summertime, wander around with an ice cream in one hand and dog\u2019s leash in the other while listening to buskers. In the wintertime, enjoy Christmas lights, watch people skate and absorb the joyful holiday vibes. Keep in mind that the Forks can get very crowded during festivals; unless your furry friend is very used to big crowds of people, you might want to avoid busy days.\n\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bc6VNxqjs2x\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bc6VNxqjs2x\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">every time I visit this place I make a new friend<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\">A post shared by <a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/93mp\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Winnipeg<\/a> (@93mp) on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2017-12-20T04:56:37+00:00\">Dec 19, 2017 at 8:56pm PST<\/time><\/p>\n\n<\/div><\/blockquote>\n<\/center>\n\n<strong>3. <a href=\"http:\/\/downtownwinnipegbiz.com\/business\/central-park\/\">Central Park<\/a>.<\/strong> This park is not an off-leash dog park, but pet owners love it anyway. After a 17-minute walk away from downtown, you can stroll in a peaceful place surrounded by historical architecture. The park is also a good place for a relaxing pause if you and your dog walked for a long time and need some rest. Bring a book and settle in on a bench to enjoy a relaxing day in the park.\n\n<strong>4. <a href=\"https:\/\/winnipeg.ca\/ppd\/planning\/pdf_folder\/WaterfrontDriveExpectations.pdf\">Waterfront Drive<\/a>.<\/strong> This is one of my favourite areas in Winnipeg because it combines historical and brand-new buildings with a wide sidewalk through the park. Taking a walk here feels like wandering through a picturesque forest. Dog owners, bikers, and joggers share the walking route at Waterfront Drive. The sidewalk is paved, wide, and well maintained, and runs right beside the mighty Red River. It\u2019s a lovely place to have some quality time by yourself, with a good friend, or with your dog.\n\n<strong>5. The Legislative Grounds.<\/strong> The park around the monumental <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.mb.ca\/legislature\/visiting\/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building<\/a> is easily one of the best in Winnipeg for walking with your dog. The Legislative Grounds are a bit further from 300 Main, clocking in at 21 minutes at a walking pace, but it\u2019s worth the extra effort. It\u2019s peaceful right in the middle of the city, and it\u2019s always full of dogs and their owners enjoying some time together. Personally, I believe the Legislative Grounds are so popular because it feels like time stands still there. As soon as you walk into the park and see the Legislative Building, you slow down, and a strong feeling of being part of history overcomes you. Seriously\u2014just put a leash on your dog and go experience it for yourself. Just forget about your cell phone in your pocket, and lift your eyes to the ledges of the Manitoba Legislative Building. The details might surprise you.\n\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BrQCBAEDlO9\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BrQCBAEDlO9\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mommy, look!

With a bit of planning, you can avoid a headache and find a home you\u2019re ready to commit to\u2014at least until the lease is up.\n<h4>Scope out the Neighbourhood<\/h4>\nYour neighbourhood has an enormous influence on your life, and there are a few very important things to consider when picking your perfect downtown neighbourhood.\n\nMake sure you research what sort of neighbourhood you seek to best fit your lifestyle. For example, if you like being in the center of everything, consider streets in the core of downtown Winnipeg. Streets like Graham, Garry and some areas of Portage Avenue are a five-minute walk from popular bars, restaurants and Bell MTS Place.\n\nIf you are looking for somewhere more cosmopolitan, right in the middle of a richly varied area\u2014the Exchange District may be your perfect match! This vibrant neighbourhood boasts many of Winnipeg\u2019s one-of-a-kind boutiques, coffee shops, bars and restaurants. Also, it\u2019s near the Centennial Concert Hall and Winnipeg\u2019s own China Town.\n\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BtNESe3AwDL\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BtNESe3AwDL\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by @andrewmahon<\/a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2019-01-29T03:56:35+00:00\">Jan 28, 2019 at 7:56pm PST<\/time><\/p>\n\n<\/div><\/blockquote><\/center>\n<script async src=\"\/\/www.instagram.com\/embed.js\"><\/script>\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in a more laid-back neighbourhood that\u2019s still close to entertainment, check out West Broadway. It\u2019s known for being an unofficial boundary between the hustle bustle commercial parts of downtown and the residential areas, so you get the best of both worlds. Backing onto the Assiniboine River, it\u2019s a picturesque area with elm tree canopies over streets and beautiful historic buildings.\n\nDo some extra exploring around the area to make sure it has your must-haves for a neighbourhood. Keep an eye out for nearby grocery stores, drugstores, and bus stops.\n\nWhen walking around the streets outside a potential apartment, do you feel at home? Can you picture yourself showing your friends and family around the streets near the building? That\u2019s a good sign.\n<h3>Size Does Matter<\/h3>\nWhen looking for somewhere to call home, you might start to feel like Goldilocks trying to find just the right size. Starting your apartment hunt with your basic space needs figured out will make a world of difference. Consider the following for determining the square feet of your future living space.\n\nDo you own a lot of larger-scale furniture that needs to be accommodated\u2014such as a pool table, a piano or a bulky sectional sofa? How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you want? Are you the type to spend a ton of time in your bedroom, or do you need a spacious living room? Do you love to host parties and need seating for your entourage?\n\nIf you\u2019re moving from one place to another, you might want to look for something close to the same size. If you are moving into a larger place remember that you\u2019ll have to shell out money to fill it with furniture\u2014an empty apartment just doesn\u2019t feel homey!\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about storage: how much stuff do you need to store? When touring a place or even just looking at a listing on Kijiji, pay attention to the number and size of closets. Look for a bathroom closet, kitchen storage (like cupboards or a pantry) and a coat closet. A lack of storage space can go unnoticed until move-in day when you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to store your cleaning supplies or winter coats.\n<h3>Nancy Drew that Apartment<\/h3>\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than moving into an apartment and finding unpleasant surprises in the crooks and crannies, so put on that detective hat. When you view a potential apartment, look closely at ceilings, walls and floors for any cracks, stains or other damage. Check the appliances: open the refrigerator and the oven and try out the sink faucets. Look for signs of wear and tear; these may not be necessarily deal-breakers for you, but something to alert the landlord about so you don\u2019t get dinged on your security deposit.\n\nAlso, check the cellphone reception in every room! Cellphones are a huge part of our lives so make sure you walk around the apartment checking your service bars or sending a quick text or two.\n<h3>Scope out the Neighbours<\/h3>\nIf you pass someone living inside the apartment building you\u2019re touring, say hello! Whether they say hello back, stop to chat or just walk right by will give you an idea of what your potential neighbours are like.\n\nThe perfect neighbours only exist in Hallmark movies, but you do want to feel comfortable with the people around you. It depends on the type of person you are but having neighbours that you can at least smile at in the hallways might be important to you.\n<h3>Identify Must-Have Amenities<\/h3>\nThese are different for everyone, but here are three that we consider deal-breakers:\n\nA dishwasher: You can theoretically live without a dishwasher\u2014but for the sake of your sanity and the environment, look for an apartment with one.\n\nAn elevator: Stairs may help you with your step counter on your FitBit, but on move-in day, when you\u2019re trying to move your couch up three flights of stairs, you\u2019ll be kicking yourself for renting the place!\n\nLaundry facilities: Take it from someone who is a serial renter: an on-site laundry room is the holy grail of apartment living. Having to lug all your dirty clothes back and forth from a laundromat is a pain. Do yourself a favour and put a laundry room on your list of non-negotiables.\n<h3>Trust Your Instincts<\/h3>\nWe don't call the places where we live home without a reason. If the price is right but something just feels wrong\u2014even if you can\u2019t pinpoint what\u2014trust that feeling and keep searching. The right apartment should be your home base, your personal launchpad for taking on the day and where you can cozy up to recharge.\n\nHave some pro tips for scoring the perfect apartment?

		"content": "The stereotypical trappings of urban living do not make downtown\u2014the people, food and buildings do! I began my downtown living journey when I was 19, and I\u2019ve never looked back. Something about downtown caught my interest when I was ready to move from my 130 square foot dormitory into a more grown-up apartment.\n\nAs a young adult, I couldn\u2019t decide if I wanted to create a life in an urban or suburban area. The wonderful thing about downtown Winnipeg is that combines the very best parts of Winnipeg into one neighbourhood! As the years advance and I shuffle between different downtown streets, downtown feels more and more like home.\n\nWhether you love parks, museums, music venues or creative attractions, downtown Winnipeg has something to make your heart sing. Downtown really optimizes its space with something interesting to see, eat and\/or do around every corner.\n<h3>A Mixture of Old and New<\/h3>\nDowntown mixes the old and the new, showcasing Winnipeg\u2019s attachment to its historical buildings by preserving them, scattered between modernized high rises. The older buildings are comforting and make downtown feel like more than just another concrete jungle. These mature buildings are one of the major reasons why I moved and stayed downtown; they\u2019re full of stories of what Winnipeg used to be like, and how my grandparents and parents lived their lives in these streets.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3318\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-3318\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/archway-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Archway at the Grain Exchange, Exchange District, Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" \/> Archway at the Grain Exchange building, Winnipeg[\/caption]\n<h3>You\u2019re Never Hungry<\/h3>\nDowntown serves as a melting pot, bringing together diverse people into one place\u2014and it really shows through the food! There\u2019s an assortment of eateries, which is great news for foodies like me. You can turn on to any street and be greeted by mom-and-pop bistros, one-of-a-kind cafes, or the familiar chain restaurants you can eat at just about everywhere (which I swear taste better downtown, for some reason). Food and I have a pretty steady relationship, and by living downtown I get the opportunity to experiment with all sorts of flavours!\n<h3>Building Connections<\/h3>\nSmall town living has its romance, but urban living creates intense proximity between you and the people around you. It\u2019s a common misconception that people who live in the heart of cities don\u2019t interact with each other, but I beg to differ! You share laughs with the people at the bus stop as you joke about how Winnipeg Transit buses never seem to arrive on time, make small talk with the folks on the bus that you\u2019re sardined against, groan along with people as you wait in the ridiculously long line at Tim\u2019s, and smile at the person who held the elevator door open for you. These small but meaningful interactions make up the connections of downtown dwellers. You feel that connection because frankly, you can\u2019t help it\u2014you\u2019re always in close proximity to someone.\n<h3>The People Around You<\/h3>\nIt goes without saying that in some cities, downtown can seem cold and unwelcoming. However, I believe that the benefits of urban living can be seen in each unique neighbourhood. Each neighbourhood tells the story of the people who live there, and my neighbourhood downtown is full of people from all walks of life. In my apartment building, my neighbours include a family from across the pond who made me fresh juice when I moved in, an elderly man who gives everyone a Christmas card each year, and a few male university students who shovel the front walkway every winter without being asked.

		"content": "To rent or to buy, that is the question. It\u2019s been analysed, discussed and debated for a long time, but it\u2019s never been more relevant than today: Based on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/calgary\/calgary-rent-vs-buy-reader-response-road-ahead-1.4503852\">Calgary survey<\/a>, young professionals who can afford to buy a house still prefer to rent. I\u2019ve heard doctors, teachers, and other professionals argue that they find renting more convenient than buying.\n\nPersonally, I rented for more than four years before buying a home, and I think renting is an underrated option. People will always have different opinions, and I find myself somewhere in between. I enjoy home ownership just outside of the city; I also enjoyed renting a 17<sup>th<\/sup>-floor apartment in downtown Winnipeg. Home ownership isn\u2019t for everyone, and I\u2019m here to show you that renting a home has more advantages than you might think.\n<h3>Renting is more affordable.<\/h3>\nWhen you purchase a home, you don't just pay for the property itself. You can also look forward to taxes, mortgage interest and other fees. In addition to those basics, there will be other expenses depending on the type of property you buy. We purchased a duplex, and it wasn\u2019t long before the extra costs started to add up: gardens, fencing, driveways and landscaping are expensive!\n\nUnderstanding the true cost of homeownership is not as simple as comparing a monthly mortgage payment to a rent payment. Don\u2019t even get me started on condo fees, utilities and insurance. When buying a house, you also need to be sure that you can afford to put down a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/financial-consumer-agency\/services\/mortgages\/down-payment.html\">minimum of 5% for the down payment<\/a>. Renters, on the other hand, don\u2019t need to worry about most of these expenses.\n\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-3440 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/account-bank-banking-1548994-1024x610.jpg\" alt=\"bank loan, mortgage insurance, buying a house, renting an apartment, winnipeg apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"560\" \/>\n<h3>No need to pay for maintenance.<\/h3>\nMaintenance is such a huge factor that I think it deserves its own category. Here\u2019s a great (and stinky) story about how well maintenances are usually completed by a rental company: When my husband and I came back to Winnipeg from our honeymoon in the Dominican Republic, it was almost midnight. We were tired but woke right up when we opened the door to our apartment. It smelled like something had <em>died<\/em> in there. I ran to throw open the window, and my husband checked the kitchen.\n\nIt turned out that the fridge had stopped working, and the contents of the fridge and freezer (including chicken, fish, and veggies) had been rotting for 2 weeks\u2014yuck. You can imagine the smell! Long story short, we called the property management office, and they immediately replaced our fridge. It didn't cost us a penny. Convinced yet? Let\u2019s move on to the next point.\n<h3>Renting = flexibility.<\/h3>\nUsually, a rental lease is signed for a year, and then you have the option to renew. This way you have way more freedom in planning ahead. However, sometimes even the best-planned life scenario can be ruined by unplanned situations. It could be a sudden job offer in a different city, a family emergency, or you could just decide to move because the world is a beautiful place and you have to see more of it!\n\nIf you rent, you don't have to deal with selling a house. Renting offers valuable convenience when it comes to a quick change of plans. It saves you from looking for a buyer, paying a realtor, signing papers, and looking for a new place to buy. Hand over they keys to your landlord when your lease is up, and you\u2019re free to move on.\n\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-3444 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1024x728.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Apartments, Renting vs Buying, Downtown Apartments, Downtown Living, 300 Main Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"668\" \/>\n<h3>Renting involves less emotional and financial stress.<\/h3>\nIf you\u2019ve ever been interested in buying a property, you\u2019ve probably noticed that interest rates are rising. Mortgage interest rates are the highest they\u2019ve been in 5 years, and it looks like they are destined to climb even more.\n\nAdditionally, if you cannot afford to put down 20% as a down payment, you are required to purchase mortgage insurance. Just to give a point of reference, we had to pay close to $10,000 in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca\/en\/buying\/mortgage-loan-insurance-for-consumers\">mortgage insurance<\/a> on a house purchase in the mid-$300,000 range. Property taxes in most cities have also been increasing. Taxes and interest rates add a substantial cost to home ownership that sometimes makes buying a home financially unfeasible.\n\nContrary to popular belief, renting isn\u2019t a money drain. You\u2019re paying for the roof above your head and shelter for your family. You can save on monthly expenditures and have more flexibility when it comes to your life plans. Get the most bang for your buck by investing any money that you save monthly by renting instead of owning. Over 40 years, a diversified investment portfolio can yield an equal or even greater return than investing in buying a home. Renting a place doesn\u2019t make you a homeowner, but it does free up cash flow that might otherwise be going to taxes, a mortgage, and unexpected expenses.\n<h3>Make the decision that\u2019s right for you<\/h3>\nThe decision whether to buy or rent a home shouldn\u2019t be made lightly. It should involve being honest with yourself about what you want, what you need, and lists\u2014lots of lists with numbers that will show you the advantages and disadvantages of either decision. Consider your lifestyle, your finances, and your plans. Whatever you decide, make the right decision for <em>you<\/em>, and don\u2019t worry about what others think.\n\n<em>Now, let\u2019s hear your opinion! If you have ever faced the dilemma of buying or renting, share your experience in comments below.<\/em>",

		"content": "After spending two years studying, working, and falling in love in Scotland, in October I moved into a one-bedroom suite in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theboyceloftsonross.com\/\">Boyce Lofts<\/a> in the <a href=\"https:\/\/exchangedistrict.org\/\">Exchange District<\/a>. It was the first time I didn\u2019t have to live with roommates, and the first time I didn\u2019t have to move into a furnished apartment. The Boyce Lofts were brand new and no one had lived in the space before me. It was a blank canvas (and not just because of the white walls and white cabinetry), and I was so excited to decorate and furnish it just the way I wanted.\n\nBut while my apartment has high ceilings and an open concept, it\u2019s pretty small\u2014at around 500 square feet\u2014and narrow enough that I can\u2019t fit furniture on both sides of the living\/dining room. So not only did I have to plan out the use of space, but I had to make sure I wasn\u2019t filling the space with too much. I knew my already-small space would feel even smaller with clutter and large furniture. I had to be smart about decorating.\n\nI\u2019m no design expert, but I like to think I have good taste, and I strongly believe that minimalism is the way forward. Not only does minimalism help reduce consumerism, but it helps you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/ca\/blog\/anxiety-zen\/201612\/minimalism-when-living-less-means-more-mental-health\">feel<\/a> unburdened in the place that should matter most\u2014home. So here are some tips on designing your small space.\n<h3>Storage<\/h3>\nWhen you have less space to leave things lying around, you can\u2019t afford to have much clutter! Even if you\u2019re not a messy person, it\u2019s hard to keep things clean and tidy if you simply have too much stuff. It\u2019s easy to accumulate Christmas and birthday gifts you didn\u2019t really want, impulse buys you could\u2019ve done without, and clothing and shoes.\n\nAt the same time, I understand that sometimes you just don\u2019t want to be looking at your things, especially if it\u2019s miscellaneous stuff you\u2019re unsure where to store. Small-space living is your chance to get creative!\n\nBefore you move into your small space, purge your belongings. Donate or sell them things you don\u2019t want or need (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.siloam.ca\/donate\/donate\/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=siloam%20mission&amp;utm_campaign=paid&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqt7jBRAcEiwAof2uK9QVeCxi4pU-My2leJVWHSvKIY9wy_26stHto4zZ_d46JGC9wNY6qBoCMXwQAvD_BwE\">Siloam Mission<\/a> gratefully accepts new and gently used clothing!). Not only will you feel unburdened from all these nonessential objects, but your small space will feel bigger and you\u2019ll have more room to work with.\n\nFor storing your belongings, opt for open shelving. Closed shelving gives the illusion that your walls are closing in and that the room is even smaller. I have an abundance of kitchen cabinet space, so I use it to store some non-kitchen related items as well.\n\nUnder the bed is a great place to store items you don\u2019t use very often. You can buy long, slim boxes exactly for this purpose, or you can even get a storage bed that has built-in storage under the mattress.\n\nIf your building has storage lockers, use yours! They\u2019re handy for storing larger items like suitcases, bicycles, and seasonal clothing. Items that are essential, but seasonal, and too clunky to be keeping in your apartment year-long.\n<h3>Furniture<\/h3>\nWhen <a href=\"http:\/\/hutk.ca\/\">choosing furniture<\/a> for your small space, look for pieces that are light and don\u2019t take up a lot of space, or that give the illusion that they don\u2019t. Avoid big, clunky, overstuffed furniture, and choose pieces that are low to the ground and have exposed legs.\n\nGo for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interiorillusions.ca\/product-category\/furniture\/living-room\/accent-chairs\/\">sleek armless chairs<\/a>, and try transparent coffee tables, which won\u2019t look like they\u2019re taking any room at all. Think about using two small coffee tables instead of one big one that takes up a lot of space.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3430\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-3430\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Interior Illusions, Interior Design, Small Space, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"940\" \/> by @interior_illusions on Instagram[\/caption]\n\nDual or multipurpose pieces are key in a small space. Consider getting an ottoman instead of a coffee table so it can do double duty as extra seating. (Bonus points if it has built-in storage!) Floor cushions also make great emergency seating for when you have guests over, and you can stack them up when you\u2019re not using them.\n\nLook into getting an expandable or folding dining table. Keep it small when you\u2019re alone and open it up to fit all your friends around the table the next time you\u2019re hosting brunch.\n\nFor storing things like books and <a href=\"http:\/\/intothemusic.ca\/\">records<\/a>, opt for a shelving unit that is vertical, not horizontal. You\u2019ll be able to store more items while taking up less floor space. If you can, install floating shelves to avoid using up precious square footage. They\u2019re sleek, easy to set up, and you can arrange them however you like.\n\nA TV media console can take up a lot of space, so mount your television on the wall to minimize the use of floor space. I took it a step further and got a projector\u2014they\u2019re cheaper, much smaller, easily transportable, and a great alternative to a clunky television if you have white walls.\n<h3>Decoration<\/h3>\nPlants are the easiest way to decorate and brighten up your space. If you have a history of being bad at keeping plants alive (guilty as charged!), try a cactus or a bonsai; they\u2019re small, cute, and can withstand being over or under watered. Stop by <a href=\"http:\/\/verdeplantdesign.com\/\">Verde Plant Design<\/a> for a great selection!\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to decorate your walls with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wag.ca\/visit\/shop\">art<\/a> that you love. Mirrors make a space look larger, so go on the hunt for a mirror with a stylish frame. A stylish mirror can function as part of your decor, not just something you check to make sure you look good before heading out the door.\n\nHang your curtains from the ceiling, not at the top of the window frame\u2014it\u2019ll create the illusion of higher ceilings and a larger space.\n\nWhen it comes to creating a colour palette for a small space, use colour sparingly. Use light colours for your walls and furniture, and dark or bold colours as accents only, such as throw pillows, vases, or lamps. Try to create a colour palette that uses only two to three colours.\n<h3>Getting Started<\/h3>\nWhere do you spend the most time? Focus your spending on that area to get the most out of your budget. If you like sleeping, invest in a bed you can\u2019t wait to crawl into; if you like watching TV, invest in a cozy sofa; if you work from home, invest in a good working space, with a comfy chair and a nice desk. Make a plan, and don\u2019t buy everything at once. Get the important things like your bed and your sofa first, live with it for a bit, and feel out what you need to get next; you might surprise yourself!\n\n<em>Any tips for decorating a small space?

		"content": "There are few decisions in life as important as your first home. And with the housing market rising, everyone seems to have advice about this decision. Millennials who are moving to bigger cities feel the pressure to get into the market. They\u2019re told that buying is the smart move, and renting is just throwing away money. But is it? I took a look at the numbers and found six reasons why renting for Millennials is sometimes the best option.\n<h3>\u201cYou build equity when you buy a house\u201d<\/h3>\nThis statement is<a href=\"https:\/\/affordanything.com\/is-renting-better-than-buying-should-i-rent-or-buy\/\"> frequently used as an argument against renting<\/a>. The tenant rents for years and the landlord makes a profit, when the tenant could be using that money to save for a down payment or paying off a mortgage. On a basic level this is true, but it overstates the idea of gaining <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/equity.asp\">equity<\/a> from owning a property. Most 30-year mortgages build very little equity over the first 20 years, and only start building equity in the last decade. Most of your mortgage payment in the first two-thirds of time that you own a property is going towards insurance, taxes, and the organization that gave you the mortgage. Unless you\u2019re very sure you are going to live in this house for the next 30 years, you\u2019ll build minimal equity.\n\nHouse values also tend to increase with inflation. There have been very few periods in the last 100 years when house prices have risen beyond inflation, and when they did, they eventually declined when the \u201cbubble burst.\u201d When a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/h\/housing_bubble.asp\">housing bubble<\/a> bursts, the market value of your home quickly declines\u2014but your mortgage debt doesn\u2019t. Unless you get lucky and buy the right property at the exact right time in the right location, the chance of your house value rising by significantly more than the rate of inflation is minimal.\n<h3>Being tied to a place for an allotted time<\/h3>\nMillennials are lucky to have started our careers at a time dominated by technology. Many people have the freedom to work remotely from their computer. This freedom does not mesh well with a mortgage payment, which only sees equity growth in its later years. The economy is changing, and Millennials tend to go back to school or switch careers more often than baby boomers, but there\u2019s little incentive for us to tie ourselves down to a 30-year mortgage until we know we\u2019ll be staying in one place for a long time. Renting allows Millennials the freedom to spend money on travel, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/petesaunders1\/2017\/01\/12\/where-educated-millennials-are-moving\/#f706ec0d3ccc\">starting a business<\/a>, or paying off student debt, rather than having money tied down in a place where you aren\u2019t sure you will want to live for the next three decades.\n\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-3672 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Millenials, renting, buying a house, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/>\n<h3>There are better ways to grow your wealth<\/h3>\nNot only are the gains of equity from buying a house in some ways overstated, but if investment is your goal, there are more profitable ways to go about it. Renting can save you a lot of money on your yearly spending, and that money can be used to invest in stocks, ETF\u2019s, Index Mutual funds, RRSP\u2019s and other investment strategies that have a higher overall gain. As mentioned above, house prices tend to increase alongside inflation. Adjusting for that, a house in 1897 cost the same as a house in 1997. As for investing, The Financial Planning Standards Council <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tangerine.ca\/forwardthinking\/investing\/what-is-a-realistic-rate-of-return-on-an-investment-portfolio\">states that<\/a>, \u201cReturn assumptions for a balanced portfolio range from 4.55%\u2026to 6.05%.\u201d Therefore, investing in stocks and bonds with the cash you\u2019ve saved from renting is a more profitable option. The money you gain over years can be used to buy a home in a city that you know you\u2019ll stay in.\n<h3>Peace of mind<\/h3>\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/financial-edge\/1112\/reasons-renting-is-better-than-buying.aspx\">lack of stress about maintenance or repair fees is a major perk of renting<\/a> as well, as the landlord or building manager responsible for these. This removes a major source of worry from your life as a renter, since you don\u2019t have to think about replacing the furnace or the pipes if they break or hiring someone to check problems in your house. I know many homeowners who are frustrated with the amount of work they have to do just to maintain their living space. Renovations and repairs can be a huge drain, both financially and of your time. Renting allows you to spend your free time enjoying your home, not just keeping it in order.\n\nAnother way renting removes stress is that you don\u2019t have to worry about fluctuating markets and property taxes. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.mb.ca\/cca\/rtb\/rentincreaseguideline\/calculate.html\">In Manitoba, the most rent can increase is 1% and 3% each year (with some exceptions)<\/a>, which many renters can manage. Property taxes, on the other hand, can rise by more, and the value of your home can swing wildly without you having any ability to budget for it. Knowing how much you are paying at the beginning of every month is a big stress reliever for Millennials, who often freelance and work jobs that are more fluid.\n<h3>Amenities and extras<\/h3>\nNot a lot of people have a pool, a gym, a party room, or a tennis court in their house. But with a lot of newer condominiums, these are built in! These facilities are right in the building and make exercise and social gatherings easy and affordable, which is important in our society where we all seem to be so busy. These amenities would normally require Millennials to pay a membership to a gym or club, plus transportation costs. With many buildings having these amenities built in, it saves renters both money and time. Not to mention the cost of having these perks in your home as an owner would vastly outweigh what renters spend for building fees in a year!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3674\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-3674\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Amenities, Gym, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/> ? by Humphrey Muleba from Unsplash[\/caption]\n\nAnother benefit with renting a condo or apartment is that you are surrounded by a built-in community. Many of my good friends are people who rented beside me, went to the dog park at my building or who I just bumped into in my neighbourhood at some point. You\u2019re surrounded by hundreds of neighbours in an apartment building, which can come in handy when you need someone to watch your dog for a day, borrow a drill for a project, or just want to get together with some new friends.\n<h3>It is the best option<\/h3>\nThanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/business.financialpost.com\/personal-finance\/young-money\/student-debt-the-crippling-side-effect-of-education\">rising student debt<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/business\/house-prices-affordability-income-1.4966211\">tough housing market<\/a>, many Millennials have no choice but to move back in with their parents after going to college or university. In these cases, for a young professional looking to live on their own, renting is a better option. The freedom of living on your own without the stress of the housing market allows Millennials to get closer to their dreams while saving up money and building a life.\n\nAccording to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/09\/05\/its-better-to-rent-than-to-buy-in-todays-housing-market.html\">new research<\/a> from Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University Faculty, \u201cRenting and reinvesting the savings from renting, on average, will outperform owning and building home equity, in terms of wealth creation,\u201d which can allow younger people to live the life they want. Traveling, being in a city, having a safe home, and chasing your career: all of this is possible and more attainable while renting. Renting isn\u2019t throwing away money; you get to live in a place with all the amenities of owning a home, without any of the costs of upkeep! Don\u2019t let old advice keep you from living your dream.\n\n<em>Have you chosen to rent? Are you a happy homeowner? Tell us why that choice was right for you in the comments!<\/em>",

		"content": "Whether you just finished binging Marie Kondo\u2019s Netflix series or are just looking for a neater home, decluttering is a key part of spring cleaning.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there: Despite your best intentions, what was once a spotless and organized space has now drawn piles of clutter like moths to the flame. Don\u2019t waste time feeling embarrassed; we\u2019ve all been there! Follow these quick tips and you\u2019ll feel like you have a new apartment by spring.\n<h3>Create a Schedule and Set Aside the Time<\/h3>\nStart off by making a list of all the rooms in your apartment, and don\u2019t forget coat closets or cleaning supplies closets! No two rooms will need the same amount of time; your bathroom might take 30 minutes whereas your bedroom could take half a day.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the rooms you need to tackle, create a schedule and be specific about what you hope to accomplish in each room. For example, your goal for your kitchen might be to create more countertop room, or you might want to clear more wardrobe space in your bedroom.\n<h3>Out with the Old<\/h3>\nWinter clothing can truly take a beating in these harsh chilly months. Set aside a couple of hours and inspect your wardrobe. Recycle any hole-infested sweaters and worn-down thermal socks.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3617\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-3617\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"De-cluttering, Spring Cleaning, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/> by Dan Gold from Unsplash[\/caption]\n\nClothes are one of the easiest things to collect and hoard within your home. Ask yourself, \u201cHave I worn this in the past 6 months?\u201d If you haven\u2019t (be honest!) and there\u2019s no sentimental value to it (like a wedding dress or your grandmother\u2019s hand-knit sweater,) donate it. You\u2019ll thank yourself later when looking for your favourite shirt doesn\u2019t count as an arm workout.\n\nIf you are anything like me, you fear getting rid of stuff because you can\u2019t help but think, \u201c<em>But what if I need this later?<\/em>\u201d Trust me on this: You\u2019re never going to need those hotel toiletries you snagged on your past six vacations, or that one phone charger that works when you place it just right\u2014it\u2019s time to toss \u2018em!\n<h3>Become Friends with your Countertops and Tables Again<\/h3>\nFlat surfaces in your apartment accumulate the most clutter because it\u2019s just so easy to let things pile up. Remove every item from the surface, including decorations, appliances and all the haphazard junk. Lay everything out on a flat surface like another table (or even the floor), so you have a clear view of each item.\n\nAn easy place to start is by throwing away all the random flyers, coupons and other non-important loose papers that tend to accumulate. Next, tackle things that spark more annoyance than joy, such as decorations you don\u2019t remember buying.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve picked the items worthy of being on your counter or table, find a permanent home for them in a convenient and logical spot. Be selective of what you keep on your counters; you don\u2019t need to have every single appliance on the counter! If you don\u2019t use it every day, store it in a cabinet or on top of the fridge.\n<h3>Don\u2019t Forget to Tackle the Junk Drawer<\/h3>\nDrawers are the first place you throw miscellaneous stuff into, especially when you\u2019re quickly tidying up. I get it; out of sight, out of mind. But this spring, we\u2019re reversing that mindset! The purpose of a junk drawer is to provide a place to store all the little odds and ends that don't quite fit in anywhere else. This is still possible, but it can be done in a more intentional way.\n\nToss anything that is expired, unnecessary or is just plain garbage. Keep extra batteries, packs of pens and chip clips, but get rid of extra chopsticks, expired coupons, and that stack of random business cards.\n<h3>Ready, Shreddy, Go!<\/h3>\nPaper junk can collect quickly, like old receipts, bank invoices or even more of those random business cards. Shredding these will clear up your office space.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3623\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"576\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-3623\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"De-cluttering, Spring Cleaning, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" \/> by Felipe Bustillo from Unsplash[\/caption]\n<h3>Collections of any Kinds Have to Go<\/h3>\nItems like books, CD\u2019s or DVD\u2019s can really pile up over the years. Ask yourself if these mementos are necessary, or just part of your past that you\u2019re holding onto. It\u2019s a brave, new virtual world, and most of us don\u2019t even have CD\/DVD players any more thanks to Netflix. So why are you wasting space for stacks of CDs from the early 2000s?\n\nThe same thing goes for books. It might be nice to look like a bookworm when your friends pop by, but you know they\u2019re mostly just taking up space. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to give up every book but ask yourself if you\u2019ll really ever read it again. If you won\u2019t, donate it.\n\nQuick Tip: Donate your books to newcomer organizations (such as N.E.E.D.S) or a senior living facility!\n<h3>Be Ruthless<\/h3>\nGetting rid of stuff in your home is difficult at first because we create connections with items. But, once you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll wonder why you didn\u2019t tackle it sooner!\n<h3>Organize the Rest<\/h3>\nDecluttering isn\u2019t just about getting rid of stuff; it\u2019s also about knowing how to manage what you have. From racks, baskets, or under-bed storage, there\u2019s an assortment of storage products for every need on the market.\n<h3>Out of Sight, Out of Mind<\/h3>\nA forgotten place that is one of the most convenient storage spaces is hiding out under your bed. Grab a few thin, narrow bins and you have the perfect place to store out of season clothes, booksyou want to keep but don\u2019t need on your shelf, or any mish-mashed items that don\u2019t seem to have a place but that you know you need.\n\nShelving units are also a great way to kill two birds with one stone: Grab a few baskets and tuck away all those miscellaneous items such as cords or craft supplies. Your shelves will look neat and aesthetically pleasing, and what they hold is your little secret.\n<h3>Celebrate!<\/h3>\nNow that your hard work is over, sit back and celebrate Apartment 2.0! Now your mission is to keep your home decluttered. Remember to follow the golden rule: Only bring things into your home that you actually need and will use. Once your apartment is decluttered, it\u2019s easy to follow into old habits and end up buying more stuff you don\u2019t need.\n\nBefore bringing something new into your home, ask yourself, \u201cDo I need this? How will this benefit my home?\u201d If you can\u2019t answer both questions, don\u2019t buy it. Another great trick is the one in, one out rule. For every item that comes into your apartment, try to get rid of one item so you don\u2019t end up with a cluttered apartment once again.\n\nThese tips might seem ambitious, but you can do it! And once you see how freeing it can feel to have less <em>stuff<\/em> around you, you\u2019ll be kicking yourself for not starting sooner. What\u2019s your personal decluttering challenge?",

		"content": "When Winnipeg finally introduced itself to me, it was not the first time I had been to the city. The very first time I had been to Winnipeg was on a cold December afternoon when my family moved from Russia to Canada. Our friends met us at the airport, and we drove straight from the airport to a small city just south of Winnipeg. Winnipeg and I didn't get a chance to get to know each other yet.\n\nThe next few times when I visited Winnipeg with friends, we mainly went shopping at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfshops.com\/polo-park.html\">Polo Park<\/a>. To really get to know the city, you need to get out and explore its oldest parts. You must open your eyes to seeing history, and your ears to hearing what the city wants to tell you. That is exactly what happened to me when I came back to Winnipeg with a pile of documents to apply to college.\n\nThat morning, my sister and I had one specific mission: to explore. We got Starbucks and started our walk from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fairmont.com\/winnipeg\/\">Fairmont Hotel<\/a> on Portage Avenue, through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.exchangedistrict.org\/\">Exchange District<\/a>, and back to Portage Avenue. I was lifting my eyes, trying to catch architectural details on buildings like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhs.mb.ca\/docs\/sites\/unionbankbuilding.shtml\">Union Bank on Main Street<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/pantagesplayhouse.com\/\">Pantages Playhouse Theatre<\/a> on Market Street, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhs.mb.ca\/docs\/sites\/maltesecrossbuilding.shtml\">Maltese Cross Building<\/a> on King Street, and others. I was enjoying the fresh summer morning air and a strong feeling of familiarity that was pressing on me from all sides. It was a long walk, but that morning something hit me. It was <em>d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu<\/em> feeling that I had already been in this place before. I felt like I'd seen it before, and not just once.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3876\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"819\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BSe9ybtBCjl\/\"><img class=\"wp-image-3876 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/by-arianneyuson-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/a> ? by @arianneyuson from Instagram[\/caption]\n\nLater, while studying in college and spending all my free time in the Exchange District, I found out that movies about early 20th century Chicago had been shot in Winnipeg. Puzzle pieces fell into place. That is where I had seen these streets before I fell in love with them! I'd seen the <a href=\"https:\/\/mbfilmmusic.ca\/en\/film\/filming-in-manitoba\">streets of Winnipeg in movies<\/a> when I still lived in Russia.\n\nWinnipeg has been called \"Little Chicago\" or most commonly \"<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exchange_District\">The Chicago of the North<\/a>\" for good reason. At the turn of the century, Chicago and Winnipeg were rivals. Is that hard to believe? Before World War I, Winnipeg was the fastest-growing city in North America. By 1911 Winnipeg was the third-largest city in Canada. Winnipeg, like Chicago, was an international finance, industry, and transportation hub. From the late 1800s to the early 1900s, Chicago architects came to Winnipeg to practice their art and technique in buildings designs. They designed many buildings in the Exchange District. The Chicago architects' style influenced and inspired local Winnipeg architects, and the city kept growing in the Chicago style.\n\nOne of the best examples of the Chicago style is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhs.mb.ca\/docs\/sites\/maltesecrossbuilding.shtml\">Maltese Cross Building<\/a> at 66 King Street. Personally, this building always made my imagination run towards early <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0000095\/\">Woody Allen<\/a> movies about New York, love, and love in New York. (Even though we\u2019re talking about Chicago.) The building was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhs.mb.ca\/docs\/people\/atchison_jd.shtml\">J.D. Atchison<\/a>, a Chicago architect who moved to Winnipeg in 1905. Atchison designed nearly 100 buildings in the Exchange District area.\n\nI also want to highlight the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhs.mb.ca\/docs\/sites\/confederationbuilding.shtml\">Confederation Life Building on Main Street<\/a>. I remember walking by that building, staring at its detail and marvelling at how much effort and creativity someone had to put into it. The Confederation Life Building was designed by a Toronto architect named <a href=\"https:\/\/www.historicplaces.ca\/en\/rep-reg\/place-lieu.aspx?id=5950\">Wilson Gray<\/a>, who was influenced by Chicago style. This building is such an example of power, dignity, and strength that it takes your breath just for a moment. Next time you walk downtown and turn on Main Street, pay attention to the roof of the building. I promise, the details will surprise you, and perhaps inspire you to create something beautiful yourself.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3874\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/DSC01294-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/>\n\nMany locations in Winnipeg were inspired by the Chicago style. That\u2019s why film directors do not hesitate to use Winnipeg streets as location sets when a plot includes scenes in 20th century Chicago. \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0358135\/locations\">Shall We Dance<\/a>,\" with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, was shot in Winnipeg but set in Chicago. Just writing this makes me want to watch that movie again and point out all the familiar streets that now hold so many memories for me.\n\nOther common links between Winnipeg and Chicago are water and wind. Chicago is located on the shores of Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River; Winnipeg was born at the cross of the Assiniboine and Red rivers. Both cities are built on an open prairie area near a fresh water source. At the beginning of 20th century, Winnipeg was a transportation hub, with access to one of the longest rivers in Canada (the Assiniboine River stretches over 1,070 kilometres).\n\nBeing built on open shores of lakes and rivers explains why both cities are known as windy cities. The average wind speed in Chicago is 16.6 km\/hr, while Winnipeg wind speeds can reach 17.1 km\/hr. If you think those are not big numbers, try to stand at the intersection of Portage and Main on a cold and windy February afternoon! Winnipeg\u2019s wind speed is the second highest of any city in Canada, after Regina, Saskatchewan (18.4 km\/hr). Chicago is also in second place, after Boston, Massachusetts (20.0 km\/hr). On November 20, 1892, the Freeborn County Standard of Albert Lea, Minnesota, had <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Windy_City_(nickname)\">this to say<\/a> about Chicago being called the Windy City:\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-3880 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Portage-and-Main-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u201cBut in another sense, Chicago is actually earning the title of the \u2018windy\u2019 city. It is one of the effects of the tall buildings, which engineers and architects apparently did not foresee that the wind is sucked down into the streets. Go ahead and walk past the Masonic Temple or the Auditorium. A day that may be perfectly calm elsewhere, will meet you with a lively breeze at the base of the buildings that will compel you to put your hand to your hat.\u201d<\/p>\nI\u2019ve experienced exactly that many times while walking in downtown Winnipeg. The summer wind always tries to take my hats (but I always catch them, and lucky strangers get a laugh as I jog after my hat).\n\nWinnipeg, the Chicago of the North, has everything you need to take a trip back in time and land in 1905 Chicago. Chicago\u2019s influence is all around: J.D. Atchison designed both the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cmu.ca\/\">Canadian Mennonite University<\/a>, the stunning <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhs.mb.ca\/docs\/sites\/unionbankbuilding.shtml\">Union Bank Building<\/a>, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.virtual.heritagewinnipeg.com\/vignettes\/vignettes_039.htm\">Great-West Life building on Lombard Avenue<\/a>.\n\nThe architecture in our city is beautiful and artistic; open your eyes, turn on your imagination, and maybe even look into the history of your favourite buildings. The effort is so worth it.\n\n<em>Now, it is your turn to share! What\u2019s your favourite Chicago-style building in Winnipeg?<\/em>",

		"content": "If you own your own business, you may need or want to work from home. This can be a great way to save yourself money and cut commuting time, but there are also potential pitfalls!\n\nI\u2019ve used a home office for my writing and editing business since 2010, so I\u2019m here to help with some tips about working from home and maintaining your sanity.\n<h3>Finding a space to work<\/h3>\nThe first thing you need to decide is where in your home you want to work. This can be tricky when space is tight. My first home office was in my downtown apartment. I only had one bedroom, so I couldn\u2019t convert it to office space. I did have a large living room, so I set up my desk and office equipment on one side of it.\n\nEnsure your spot isn\u2019t too enticing to encroach on. For example, if you have to work in your living room, setting up your desk near the front door might not work out. Your workspace could become a tempting spot to dump your coat, mail or keys when you walk in the door. Try to avoid creating your workspace in a high-traffic area, lest it become a repository for personal junk.\n\nYou also need to consider lighting for your workspace. This is especially important if you\u2019re a creative type and are doing painting, sewing, etc., in your home. Look for a spot near a window for natural sunlight. It also feels good to be able to look up and see the world while you\u2019re hard at work.\n\nNoise will be another factor when choosing where to work. Some of you may love background noise, such as the radio or other people talking and moving about. I hate it and don\u2019t work well with noise, so I always look for a quiet spot.\n\nFinally, try to make your space enticing to you. In my current home, we have a second bedroom for my office\u2014but I mostly use it for business storage. I prefer working in my open kitchen at my big wooden table. I like being able to see a lot of things when I look up. If I\u2019m at my desk in my office, I see wall. I learned too late that I should have turned my desk facing into the room instead of putting it against the wall, flanked by two big bookcases, as I don\u2019t like feeling hemmed in while working. The moral of the story is to ensure your workspace makes you happy before you nail a desk to the wall.\n\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-4172 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Work from home, 300 Main Winnipeg Downtown Apartments, Home office, Renting\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/>\n<h3>Storage<\/h3>\nHaving adequate storage for your business items can also be tough in a small space. You might need a big desk, filing cabinets or somewhere to keep your materials and paint. Having worked in many tight spaces, I love Ikea for their storage items because they are particularly skilled at offering goods meant for small spaces. You might have luck finding a smaller desk or storage items that can double as something else.\n\nI\u2019ve always liked footstools that double as storage boxes. I can keep items hidden away and still have space to rest my weary feet at the end of the day. Shelving that hangs on walls is also helpful. It saves floor space and can provide a nice visual piece in your home if you load it up properly. Look for anywhere you can store things in or under to maximize your use of space.\n\nAsk yourself if you can store more items electronically, rather than needing filing cabinets for everything. You might also have items you use infrequently and can store offsite or in harder to reach places in your home. I\u2019m prone to towering piles of papers and books, so I need to take more of my own advice.\n<h3>Tax considerations<\/h3>\nThis is the un-fun stuff, but you still need to pay attention. If you work for yourself from home, you can use part of your home expenses, such as rent and hydro, as business write-offs. There is a caveat though: CRA says the space must be used exclusively for your business. If it doubles as personal use, no dice. When I was in my apartment, I couldn\u2019t write off part of my rent because my office was smack in the middle of my living room, which I also used for personal reasons. If you only have one bedroom, you might be in this same bind. Talk to your accountant to see what you can do about making your space eligible for home office deductions.\n<h3>The whole work-life balance thing<\/h3>\nThe other problem to watch out for is the temptation to be working, or thinking about working, all the time. When your home and office are the same place, it can be difficult to pull yourself out of work mode. You can be sitting on your couch watching your favourite show, and something on your desk will catch your eye and try to lure you back to work. This is another reason picking the right work spot is critical. You don\u2019t always want your work to be staring you in the face!\n\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-4169 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/adult-from-above-hair-983818-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Work from home, 300 Main Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n\nYou might need to set specific boundaries for work hours to keep you from working day and night. For example, you could choose not to work or answer the phone on weekends or past 6 pm. As you spend more time working at home, you will realize what your trouble spots are, so you can create a plan to overcome them.\n\nYou could also face the opposite problem. When you should be working, your TV or the book you left lying out last night might try to lure you back to leisure. You might need to set specific hours and boundaries for play time and naps that don\u2019t keep you from earning a living. (Reading is great, but starvation is bad!)\n\nIf you\u2019re an introvert like me, you might feel tempted to never leave your home because everything you need is right there. Don\u2019t get sucked into this vortex. We all need to go out sometimes, even if it\u2019s just for a walk by ourselves. Try to plan regular outings. Join a professional organization related to your work, a Toastmasters club, a book club or anything else that will get you out of the house and socializing on occasion. Being a complete hermit is never a good idea.\n<h3>Bottom line<\/h3>\nWorking from home can be great. I love being able to sleep late and have a commute that\u2019s about 10 steps long. I don\u2019t have to get gussied up to go anywhere and I can decide what I want for lunch at lunch time. The dog and I can take a break and go for a stroll midday. I even have someone to talk to in person when my husband gets home from work. But that doesn\u2019t mean working from home is a perfect solution.\n\nTo set yourself up for success, create a good workspace and plan specific work and leisure times. Talking to others who work from home is also a great way to learn new tips and coping mechanisms, so try to cultivate relationships with other self-employed people. With a little careful planning, you can have a successful work-from-home life that brings you satisfaction!\n\n<em>Do you work from home?

		"content": "As the Winnipeg Jets return to the Stanley Cup Playoffs, so does whiteout season! Whether you\u2019re a die-hard hockey fan or just want to support Winnipeg\u2019s team, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/wpgwhiteout\/\">#WinnipegWhiteout<\/a> gives you a chance to come together and celebrate!\n<h3>What to Expect<\/h3>\nThe energy on the streets during the whiteout is unmatched. There\u2019s something special about half of your city piling onto the streets, decked out in white and the hometown team\u2019s apparel.\n\nStarting this year, there\u2019s a cover fee of $5.00, but the fun you will have is priceless. All proceeds are going to <a href=\"https:\/\/unitedwaywinnipeg.ca\/\">The United Way<\/a>, which will scatter the funds to several organizations in the city helping individuals with mental health and addiction services.\n\nBut that seems to be the only thing that\u2019s changing\u2014seasoned whiteout goers can expect to see the same parties, with huge screens playing the game, local food trucks, beverages (both adult and youth-friendly), snacks, and activities. If you have tots in tow, the alcohol-free family zone at the <a href=\"http:\/\/winnipeglibraryfoundation.ca\/tour-the-park\/\">Millennium Library Park<\/a> has room for up to 4,000 people!\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4185\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/FullSizeRender-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Cup, Winnipeg White Out Street Party, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Events, Go Jets Go, Winnipeg Jets, NHL Playoffs, Hockey Playoffs, Ice Hockey, Sports, Game Day, #WPGWhiteOut\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/>\n<h3>Prepare for a Whiteout<\/h3>\nWhiteout parties start exactly 2 hours before each game and the streets get packed fast, so make sure to get there on time if you want to get the full whiteout experience. <a href=\"https:\/\/www1.ticketmaster.ca\/winnipeg-jets-whiteout-street-party-home-game-2\/event\/11005682CCE54415\">Buying a ticket<\/a> doesn\u2019t guarantee you a spot on the street. The street party is capped at 15,000 people for safety reasons (unless you have a ticket to the game).\n\nFrom personal experience, I recommend coordinating beforehand if you\u2019re meeting a group of friends. Cell reception can be a bit dodgy and slow with the giant mass amount of people around you, and texting them \u201cI\u2019m by the screen, I\u2019m the one wearing white!\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly work in this situation.\n\nDon\u2019t have a white Winnipeg Jets jersey? Don\u2019t fret! Every white get-up is welcome, even a basic white tee-shirt. If you\u2019re feeling extra festive, get creative! Grab a white wig, a white tutu, or whatever\u2014there\u2019s no better time to bust out that funky white hat stored in your Halloween costume box.\n<h3>Pack the Essentials<\/h3>\nWater bottle and a snack: You\u2019re going to spend hours watching the game, chatting with your friends, and just enjoying the hustle and bustle of the party. Stay hydrated and energized by keeping a small snack and a water bottle with you. This also will save you a few bucks!\n\nBattery Pack: You\u2019re going to want to capture every Instagram-worthy moment, and that is going to drain your phone fast!\n\nJacket: As we get further into spring, we Winnipeggers tend to get a bit overconfident about what will be warm enough for us to wear. It may not be that cold at 5 pm when the parties start, but towards the end of the night, you\u2019ll want something to wrap around you. Pack a lightweight jacket (white, obviously) just in case!\n<h3>Get Around Downtown<\/h3>\nWhiteout parties are great for those of us going, but if you can\u2019t make the excitement, navigating around downtown can be torturous! Here are the roads that will be closed during whiteout parties:\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economicdevelopmentwinnipeg.com\/winnipeg-whiteout\/maps-and-resources?camefrom=EMCL_2841648_134922198\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4181 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Whiteout Street Party, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Jets, Go Jets Go, NHL Playoffs, Hockey Playoffs, Game Day, Sports, Downtown Living\" width=\"791\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/a>\n\n\u2022 Donald between Portage and St. Mary\n\u2022 Graham between Hargrave and Smith\n\u2022 Smith between Portage and St. Mary\n\nThese streets will be closed from 11:30 a.m. Friday through 6:30 a.m. Saturday for today\u2019s party.\n<h3>Personal Experience<\/h3>\nMy first whiteout was last spring, and as soon as I jumped off the bus onto Graham street, it was if I walked into a different dimension! For as far as my eyes could see, everyone was decked out in white. My nose quickly caught a whiff of the food trucks surrounding me, and my ears were bulldozed with the laughter and chatter of the crowd around me. I followed a mass of people to the center of the street, where hundreds upon hundreds of people were already gathered, getting ready for the game to light up the massive screen in front of us.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a die-hard fan for the excitement to exist in you. Before experiencing my first whiteout, I enjoyed the occasional hockey game. But as soon as the screen switched on and the first puck hit the ice, I was roaring in unison with the crowd around me. We were loud and proud, screaming the second the Jets hit the ice, singing along to the Canadian anthem, and we kept up that enthusiasm until seconds before the Jets sunk their winning goal at the end of the game. It was like the entire crowd\u2014no, the entire city\u2014was holding its breath. Silence overcame the streets as our eyes were glued to the screen, waiting for the puck to hit net. As soon as it did, we were like a shaken soda bottle\u2014the street exploded in deafening cheers! There must be cracks in the foundations of the buildings around us thanks to the deafening noise the Winnipeggers on the streets were making. I am honestly surprised we didn\u2019t get a noise complaint from our neighboring city. I hugged everyone around me, people I had never seen before\u2014but they felt like long-lost friends.\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BwGJe-dA0AP\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

		"content": "Looking for a breakfast\/brunch\/lunch option other than the usual pancakes or basic bacon and eggs? Clementine will enchant your taste buds with dishes that burst with flavour, at a price you won\u2019t be mad about.\n\nClementine is a true hidden gem in the middle of downtown Winnipeg. Located in the Exchange District at 123 Princess Street, this cozy restaurant is accessible only by a stairwell wedged between a Subway and a bar. Walk too fast, and you just might miss it. You would never guess that hidden behind a plain black door that reads \u201c123\u201d would be a welcoming, intimate restaurant humming with the low voices of diners discussing how tasty their meals are.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4483\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"768\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-4483\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Clementine1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Clementine, Breakfast, Eggs Benedict, Exchange District, Shop Local,Cappuccino, Mimosa,Burger Dip, Downtown Living\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/> Burger Dip 2.0, Braised Bacon Benedict paired with cappuccino and grapefruit mimosa[\/caption]\n<h3>Atmosphere<\/h3>\nAs you descend the stairs, you\u2019ll be met with a neon light sign suggesting, \u201cEat this, it\u2019ll help.\u201d The sign doesn\u2019t lie, and you won\u2019t be disappointed. A drawback of this otherwise standout restaurant is that it isn\u2019t accessible for folks who depend on a wheelchair or are not able to walk down stairs. Sadly, Clementine is only accessible via a staircase down from street level.\n\nWarm colours, lights and textures decorate the space, creating a cozy atmosphere that pairs perfectly with a constant buzz of conversation.\n\nAnother neat feature is that the kitchen is in full view, so you can enjoy watching the staff promptly prepare your fresh meal while you sip your cappuccino.\n<h3>The Menu<\/h3>\nDon\u2019t expect your average all-Canadian breakfasts like any chain restaurant. Clementine\u2019s menu is packed with originality and superb flavors make this restaurant my number-one recommendation for breakfast or lunch.\n\nBreakfast-brunch-lunch dishes with global influence makes Clementine the \u201cgo to\u201d for hipsters, young families, and silver-haired couples alike. Clementine is known for short, but mouth-watering menu. The menu is creative and well-thought out, with an assortment of dishes for every palate.\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BiZxVs9BL6Z\/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

For instance, enjoy their porridge with mixed grains, coconut, pineapple pur\u00e9e, berries and cashews; or, be transported to Belgium with their perfectly fluffy Brussels Style Waffle (pictured above), topped with roasted berries, caramelized bananas, cinnamon whipped cream and maple syrup. Warning. Your mouth will water.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me and coffee is your main food group, Clementine does not disappoint. Whether you\u2019re looking for an espresso, latte, cappuccino, or\u2014for the truly coffee-savvy\u2014a piccolo, they offer it!\n\n<em>My recommendation:<\/em> If you want to play it safe, Fried Chicken on Toast (trust me!); if you are feeling a bit more adventurous, the Mushroom Chilaquiles is superb!\n<h3>You\u2019re a Guest not a Customer<\/h3>\nThe service is unbeatable, with staff who are warm and attentive. They have no issue offering you or your group suggestions or explanations for their unique menu options. One peek into their bustling kitchen, and you\u2019ll see how hard their team works to provide you with a truly delicious dish!\n<h3>Good to Know<\/h3>\nClementine\u2019s one downside is that they are open from 7 am to 3 pm (weekdays) and 8 am to 4 pm (weekends), so your after-work cravings will have to wait! They also get busy fast. If you\u2019re looking for a quick breakfast, I highly recommend arriving before 10 am on the weekends and 9:30 on weekdays. They do not take reservations.\n\nClementine is very accommodating to special dietary needs. They offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.\n\nDishes range from $6 to $15.",

		"content": "Have you ever considered the best ways to get around Winnipeg without a car? You might scoff and think there\u2019s no way you want to move around this frigid city without one, but not everyone has access to a vehicle. Others are also worried about the environmental damage cars do.\n\nAs someone who doesn\u2019t drive, I\u2019ve spent all of my adult life trying to move around cities without a vehicle. And I promise you, you can do it. Let\u2019s look at your options.\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/winnipegtransit.com\/en\">Winnipeg Transit<\/a><\/h3>\nYou can ride the good ol\u2019 bus to move around our city. The service isn\u2019t great from some outlying suburban areas, but you can reach most everywhere by bus. And it\u2019s easy to figure out, too. There\u2019s a Winnipeg Transit app you can download onto your phone. You can also use the Winnipeg Transit <a href=\"https:\/\/m.winnipegtransit.com\/navigo\">Navigo website<\/a>.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4648\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-4648\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/IMG_2416-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Transit, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" \/> Very Canadian[\/caption]\n\nWith either version, you enter your departing address, your destination, and the time you need to arrive or leave. Navigo will then show you all your options to get where you are going, including walking time and time between transfers. You can also monitor a particular stop if you want to see when buses will arrive. The app\/website shows where buses are in real time by tracking the fleet with GPS. This takes the guesswork out of knowing when your bus will arrive, which is particularly helpful on nasty weather days. The city could do better with transit, and we need more rapid transit routes, but this is one way you can get around Winnipeg.\n\nIf you need to get around downtown, you can hop aboard one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/winnipegtransit.com\/en\/service\/downtownspirit\/\">Downtown Spirit buses<\/a>. They take a couple of different routes through the downtown area. The best part? <strong>The Downtown Spirit is always free!<\/strong>\n<h3>Your Bike<\/h3>\nIf you want to stay in shape and avoid all carbon emissions, cycling might be the way to go. And yes, you can cycle here year-round. (At least if you\u2019re the hardy type.) The advent of fat bike tires can help you with winter cycling.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<center><\/center>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BbiIIHEBsQ_\/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BbiIIHEBsQ_\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In Winnipeg, we never put our bikes away... we just let some air out of the tires and go about our day!! . . . #canon60D #donsaction #Winnipeg #exploremb #explorecanada #artofvisuals #visualsgang #royalsnappingartist #way2ill #gramslayers #cityscape #paradisecanada #TrailsManitoba #exploreeverything #onlyinthepeg #allthingswinnipeg #visualscollective #world_great #discoverearth #discoverglobe #imagesofcanada #tourcanada #paradisecanada #moodygrams #agameoftones #vscogram #visualambassadors #visualcreators #canadagram #winteriscoming<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\">A post shared by <a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/joshuaa_blade\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Josh<\/a> (@joshuaa_blade) on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2017-11-15T22:49:05+00:00\">Nov 15, 2017 at 2:49pm PST<\/time><\/p>\n\n<\/div><\/blockquote>\n<script async src=\"\/\/www.instagram.com\/embed.js\"><\/script>\n\nWhile you can cycle all city streets in Winnipeg, not everyone loves sharing the road with larger, faster moving cars. The city does have a series of dedicated bike routes, including downtown bike lanes. If you aren\u2019t sure where to find these, the city provides a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/winnipeg.ca\/publicworks\/pedestriansCycling\/maps\/default.stm\">bike maps to help you plan your trip<\/a>.\n\nBiking is a great way to see Winnipeg, particularly many of our downtown parks and pretty spaces!\n<h3>Your Feet<\/h3>\nAnother great way to get in your daily exercise and protect the environment is by simply using your feet to move you from point A to point B. I used to live in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.osbornevillage.com\/\">Osborne Village<\/a> and walked to work downtown every day, even in -35 degree weather.\n\nYou can\u2019t walk everywhere, but consider walking for your shorter trips. You will need good shoes (or good winter boots with grip) to stay comfortable, but those are far cheaper than a car. Wearing a good base layer or snow pants with your coat, hat and mitts can keep you nice and toasty in the winter. You also generate a fair amount of body heat when you\u2019re moving around. Just make sure you invest in good quality gear; the super-cheap stuff might leave you too cold or too sweaty under your coat.\n\nWalking is great for your health, as is spending time outdoors in general. It can be difficult to walk down sidewalks in winter before the plows come up, but you can use the street instead (in residential areas). Or, you could truly embrace our winters and pull out your snowshoes!\n\nDowntown is a great place to walk, particularly around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theforks.com\/\">The Forks<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhs.mb.ca\/docs\/sites\/jubapark.shtml\">Stephen Juba Park<\/a>. You will find many pretty things to see as you promenade along the water. In the winter, you can walk on the Red or Assiniboine and see all of the delightful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.warminghuts.com\/\">warming huts near the Forks<\/a>.\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tappcar.com\/\">Tapp Car<\/a><\/h3>\nThere might be times when you need to get somewhere that isn\u2019t easily accessible except by car. You can use our local taxi services, but I quite enjoy Tapp Car, Winnipeg\u2019s answer to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uber.com\/ca\/en\/\">Uber<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lyft.com\/\">Lyft<\/a>. We have a few other rideshare services in the city, but I can only vouch for Tapp Car, which was the first player here.\n\nThey have an easy-to-use app that shows how long it will take your car to get to you, and shows the car make, model, colour and license plate, along with your driver\u2019s name.

You set up payment directly in the app, so you don\u2019t have to fuss with cash or a debit machine when you arrive at your destination.

		"content": "Networking\u2014a fancy term for a simple idea. Meet people, interact with them and build new relationships. We\u2019re so used to networking through social media that the thought of physically interacting with people might sound a little bit alien. You could have 300 people on your <a href=\"https:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/\">LinkedIn<\/a> network, another 300 on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/\">Facebook<\/a>, and not know any of them well enough to know where they are from. Friendly relations between neighbours encourages real-life networking, and as old school as it may sound, it\u2019s so valuable. Everyone has a story to tell, and you would probably miss the most interesting chapters if you had the same conversation online.\n\nHumans are social by nature; we need to have meaningful conversations with other people to satisfy our natural instinct to know one another. Community meet-ups and common areas encourage networking with those around us. Networking doesn\u2019t necessarily mean meeting with influential people who can help you professionally; it can also include people you can really connect with on an intellectual level. Many apartment buildings have common areas so people can lounge and get to know each other. Events like BBQs, pool parties, breakfasts and evening tea encourage tenants to get familiar with each other. While these events may seem like just a casual breakfast (free food!), they\u2019re also opportunities to discuss concerns and get valuable information. For example, downtown apartment dwellers might be happy to learn about the <a href=\"https:\/\/downtownwinnipegbiz.com\/programs-services\/safety\/watch-ambassadors\/\">Downtown Watch Ambassadors<\/a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BwK8cMVg5YP\/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BwK8cMVg5YP\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Downtown Winnipeg BIZ (@downtownwpgbiz)<\/a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2019-04-12T21:43:42+00:00\">Apr 12, 2019 at 2:43pm PDT<\/time><\/p>\n\n<\/div><\/blockquote>\n<script async src=\"\/\/www.instagram.com\/embed.js\"><\/script><\/center>\n\nNetworking isn\u2019t just about advancing your career; it\u2019s also about bonds between neighbours, an important part of apartment living. Being on good terms with your neighbours means you have someone to turn to in case of an emergency, or just to call over for a cup of tea if you\u2019re having a bad day and need someone to talk to. You can surround yourself with people you trust who can eventually become part of your support system. Good neighbours can end up feeling like family when you\u2019re living alone.\n\nThe great thing about downtown Winnipeg is the strong sense of community that the area promotes. Most apartment buildings are designed to have spaces for general use. Downtown boasts wonderful cultural diversity, making networking even more fun! You can get to know people from varied backgrounds, find out first-hand details about other cultures, and learn about entirely different ways of life.\n\nMy apartment building used to have the best BBQ parties for tenants where we would all just chat; it was fun to find out that I had a police officer and ballet dancer living on the same floor as me. At one BBQ, I saw a distinguished-looking gentleman hand over his business card to a student looking for an internship. It felt so good to be living in a community where people were looking out for each other and helping out where they could. These meet-ups can even help recent immigrants build their social circles and meet new people.\n\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-4665 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/alexis-brown-85793-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"New to Networking? Start With Your Neighbours!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/>\n\nThese BBQs also gave me a unique chance to meet people from different cultural backgrounds. The chance to listen to stories about what they did and experienced \u201cback home\u201d was really special.\n\nThe next time you\u2019re invited to a breakfast in your apartment building, think twice before deciding you\u2019d rather sleep in than get up early and meet new people. You might meet someone who can open your eyes to a new view of the world!\n\n<em>BBQs, breakfasts, and boardgame nights are just a few examples of great ways to make friends with your neighbours. What\u2019s your favourite way to meet new people?<\/em>",

No matter how big or small your place is, you can always personalize it to your exact taste by mixing and matching styles!\n<blockquote>Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.\n\u2014Coco Chanel<\/blockquote>\n[caption id=\"attachment_4681\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"951\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.biography.com\/fashion-designer\/coco-chanel#&amp;gid=ci01ac7ce9d488860c&amp;pid=coco-chanel-9244165-3-raw\"><img class=\"wp-image-4681 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/coco-chanel-9244165-3-raw-951x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Coco Chanel, Fashion, Interior Design, Fashion Design, Decor, Apartment Decor, Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"951\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/a> Photo from biography.com[\/caption]\n\nOh, I love quoting that woman! Interior design trends tend to parallel fashion. The beautiful difference between modern fashion and the styles of the 20s and 70s (years that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chanel.com\/en_CA\/\"><em>Chanel<\/em><\/a> marked the most in fashion history) is that now we mix different styles that seem to have nothing in common. Being able to adapt old, mix it with new, and add elements that reflect your true self is living fashionably.\n\nWhen it comes to interior design, mixing and matching styles makes it look like you know what you are doing. If someone tries to guess why everything around your house looks so special\u2014let them guess. The secret is as simple as Scandinavian minimalist: mix it all. Here are 5 things you need to know to get started.\n<h3>1. Do your research<\/h3>\nPerhaps you\u2019re at the threshold, about to refurnish your apartment or just moved into a new place. Either way, the question running through your mind is the same: \u201cHow do I make my home nicer, fashionable or just refreshing?\u201d\n\nAt this stage, you might already have an idea of how you want your place to look. But in the worst-case scenario, you can\u2019t even imagine; just picking a color for your new couch sounds about as fun as a polar bear dip. Either way, a little research will get your home makeover off to the right start!\n\nIf you already know what you crave, research will give you fresh ideas and inspiration. It will open up new horizons, help you make decisions, and narrow down your preferences to one or two major styles.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: we all like different things. Ask my husband and I what we think about mid-century nightstands, and you\u2019ll hear a lot of arguments. Mid-century nightstands are the only thing we couldn\u2019t agree on when furnishing our bedroom. In situations like this, doing a bit of research can uncover new ideas, compromises, and inspiration.\n\nI suggest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.ca\/\">Pinterest<\/a> (of course!), interior design books\u2014for a general feel\u2014and movies. Inspiration can come from anywhere! We\u2019re all drawn to certain items and materials that reflect our interests, preferences, and dreams. The key to d\u00e9cor that you love is to listen to that voice inside you that reacts immediately during the research phase.\n<h3>2. Modern design<\/h3>\nModern design is hard to define exactly. It reflects modern art and features the best of minimalism, sophistication, and elegance. Modern interior design is also known for its focus on practicality and usefulness. Every piece in a modern apartment should be useful, rather than artsy and architectural.\n\nSimple lines. Neutral tones. Earthy colors. Open space. That\u2019s the core of modern interior design. This aesthetic has its roots in Scandinavian and German architecture and features more colourful accents than true minimalism does (we\u2019ll get to that later).\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4686\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-4686\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/indoor-4148894_1920-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Design, Living Room, Home Decor, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Luxury Apartment\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/> From tianya1223 on Pixabay[\/caption]\n\nThe open areas, minimalistic and airy aesthetic in modern design has one big disadvantage: It can feel like an office. If you decide to go for a modern look, avoid the strictness and simplicity that is inherent to office space. Focus on details to keep your apartment feeling warm and comfortable. Sentimental photographs of your cat, colourful paintings, wool-textured blankets on the couch, and a few vintage candle holders keep a modern simple space looking cozy and welcoming.\n<h3>3. Vintage interior design<\/h3>\nRomantic, elegant and as cozy as grandma\u2019s house: that\u2019s vintage interior design. Vintage d\u00e9cor creates a feeling of nostalgia through old-fashioned style furniture and lots of texture in pillows, blankets, vases, and paintings. Details like scratches and scrapes on furniture are essential! I suggest visiting your grandparents and asking for that old, scratched-up dresser to make it a statement piece in your bedroom.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4688\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4688\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-237x300.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser\" width=\"600\" height=\"760\" \/> From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com[\/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4689\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4689\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" \/> From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com[\/caption]\n\nAs cozy as vintage can be, it\u2019s important to achieve balance between old and new. It would be easy to go to a flea market and buy a set of furniture, floral wallpaper, a record player, and call it a day; the danger is that your space might end up looking bulky and copied. It might look and feel like living in an old movie. This is where balance comes in: Use antiques and vintage finds as accents.\n\nBeside a modern grey couch, place an antique blush pink sofa chair. Instead of floral wallpaper, paint your walls grey or white and hang vintage photographs or oil paintings. Definitely show off your record player and vases, but use them sparingly! No one wants to feel like they live in a museum of a thrift store.\n<h3>4. Minimalist<\/h3>\nNeutral tones. White. Lots of white. Greenery. Wooden furniture. Wooden details. Nothing extra. Nothing extravagant. Minimalist interior design takes its cues from Scandinavia and had a huge influence on Western countries in the early 90s.\n\nMinimalism is great for making small spaces look bigger thanks to light tones and minimal furniture. Some might call minimalist design boring, but I call it clean and intellectual. It\u2019s like thinking \u201cclean\u201d and getting rid of things that are not necessary\u2014in your life and in your apartment.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4691\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"684\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-4691\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-684x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Minimalist, Minimalism, Scandinavian Design, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"684\" height=\"1024\" \/> by Alexandra Gorn from Unsplash[\/caption]\n\nThink simple lines, linen textures, and light color palettes when decorating your apartment like a minimalist. To void an empty, clinic-like feeling, add unexpected details. A painting by a young, unknown artist? Great choice! It shows off your personality and passion for art. Wooden side table with a funky architectural shape? Go for it, and make it the highlight of the room.\n\nMinimalism is all about quality, not quantity, and \u201cless is more\u201d is the rule. Combine sophisticated furniture with clean lines with small, meaningful things\u2014like that quirky painting\u2014to make your place feel special, while still keeping things simple.\n<h3>5. Mixing and matching<\/h3>\nMixing-and-matching is its own trend, complete with rules and suggestions for mixing and matching different styles. The first rule that applies in mixing styles is to express yourself boldly, but\u2014there\u2019s always a but\u2014don\u2019t go crazy and overload the space. Choose a theme (like any of the styles above) and stick to that idea to create an overall feel. Then, go and have some fun!\n\nMix old wooden chairs with colourful metal chairs around the kitchen table. Get brightly-patterned dishes and mix them with minimalistic white dishes. Hang linen curtains and throw plaid wool blankets on the couch. The possibilities are endless!\n\nThe beauty of mixing and matching is in an artsy composition. First, you create a background; I personally love light grey and white walls. Then, you can start throwing splashes of colours. Select two or three colours that work together, and use them as main accents when getting pillows, paintings and coffee mugs.\n\nMy own place is a mix of vintage and minimalist styles. I have piles of old books scattered around, paintings, black-white photographs, and a yellow 50s-style couch. I use simple wooden, grey, or white furniture as a background that I can add color to. Pillows and blankets are my two favourite accents that I can change depending on the season and my mood. While I stick to neutral colours in general, drops of colours are seen in details like bohemian dishware, my blue office chair, and colourful and light wooden photo frames.\n\nFurnishing an apartment should feel exciting and fun! You just need some patience to find those special pieces, loving eyes, time, and a will to create an outstanding space around yourself.\n\n<em>So which side are you on\u2014mixing and matching, or sticking to one style throughout?<\/em>",

They have a <a href=\"https:\/\/boonburger.ca\/menu\/#burgers\/\">menu<\/a> bursting with scrumptious vegan comfort food, a specially-curated selection of poutine, and the creamiest vegan milkshakes that will make your jaw drop\u2014what more could you want? They offer over thirty different burgers, each delicious, creative, and fried to perfection. Boon Burger is also a great place to take your meat-eater friends and family.

		"content": "Not only is downtown Winnipeg\u2014home of arguably the best restaurants, historical architecture, and free live entertainment in the city\u2014the future of Winnipeg and its economy, soon it will be home to the people that will help create that future!\n\nI\u2019ve lived all over Winnipeg with over 30 moves, and I've experienced most of the lifestyles our city has to offer. Quite honestly, downtown is the only neighbourhood that really captures the magic of Winnipeg while sidestepping any of the inconveniences, and <a href=\"https:\/\/300main.ca\/\">300 Main<\/a> snagged the perfect spot.\n<h3>Winnipeg: Chicago of the North!<\/h3>\nBy now we\u2019re all familiar with Winnipeg\u2019s claim to fame but unfortunately, people are starting to wonder if that\u2019s still relevant. I'm here to tell you why that reputation is more relevant than ever, and why you want to be at <a href=\"https:\/\/300main.ca\/\">300 Main<\/a>, the building to kick it all off!\n\n<center><iframe style=\"border: none; margin: 10px 0 0 0; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1415526985256497&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"611\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/center>Chicago is a little bit ahead of us architecturally, aren\u2019t they? The good news is, Winnipeg\u2019s architects seem eager to catch up\u2014and quick. The city\u2019s center is rapidly expanding, and Winnipeggers are determined to show their southern sister that the cold doesn\u2019t slow us down!\n\nYou just can't beat the convenience of living at <a href=\"https:\/\/300main.ca\/\">300 Main<\/a>, right at the underground mall that connects all the way down to <a href=\"https:\/\/portageplace.ca\/\">Portage Place<\/a> via the skywalk system. You\u2019ll never have to bear that true north wind, from your apartment door to your seat for the game at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bellmtsplace.ca\/\">BellMTS Place<\/a>. Just steps away, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cityplacewinnipeg.com\/\">City Place<\/a> is full of food, convenience stores, a liquor mart, and an indoor farmers market; it even connects to Winnipeg's famous <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharkclub.com\/\">Shark Club<\/a> for an affordable lunch special and maybe the occasional hand of cards between laundry flips.\n\nBut if the skywalk system to <a href=\"https:\/\/portageplace.ca\/\">Portage Place Mall<\/a> isn\u2019t long enough, almost every main bus route in the city connects within a block from your front door. With all of Winnipeg's top lounges and patios as your neighbors, you'll never miss happy hour (or pay for parking) again!\n<h3>True North Strong &amp; Your Neighbor<\/h3>\nI noticed that in Chicago, the people who work downtown live in luxury high-rises nearby. As a tourist, I felt that it created a very safe environment and an exciting downtown nightlife. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.truenorthsquare.com\/\">True North Square<\/a> will add yet another element to downtown\u2019s exciting energy.\n\n<center><iframe style=\"border: none; margin: 10px 0 0 0; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftruenorthsquare%2Fposts%2F982376771934575&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"688\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/center>Think of it as a (new) central park for Winnipeg. Set to be 2 acres, with retail, restaurants, and a stage for live entertainment, no matter what you like doing, or who you'll be there with, there will be something for everyone!\n<h3>The sky\u2019s the limit<\/h3>\nBut there's one last reason why I and many others are particularly excited about <a href=\"https:\/\/300main.ca\/\">300 Main<\/a>; it's really going to shake things up for our city! Coming in at 42 stories, it'll be Winnipeg's tallest building and I\u2019m sure the city will soar just as high.\n\nWith construction of Winnipeg\u2019s most anticipated accommodations underway at <a href=\"https:\/\/300main.ca\/\">300 Main<\/a>, downtown is where the future of the city is literally being built. I believe that <a href=\"https:\/\/300main.ca\/\">300 Main<\/a> is bringing culture and condos together, and I can\u2019t wait to see what the future looks like in downtown Winnipeg.",

		"content": "If you\u2019ve made the decision to join the world of happy dog owners, congratulations! Deciding to add a dog to your family is a big commitment, but the joy a canine companion brings can\u2019t be beat. You\u2019re probably wondering: <em>How do I choose the right dog for my apartment?<\/em> Is it a question of size? Activity level? Or something else? The answer may surprise you!\n\nBut before we head off to explore how to choose the right dog, there is some inner soul searching that needs to happen. You need to be honest with yourself about your lifestyle and what motivates your choices. You must first \u201cknow thyself\u201d in order to find a good match, so that\u2019s where we\u2019ll begin!\n<h3>The soul-searching basics<\/h3>\nWhether you are considering a move downtown or are already there, ask yourself a few lifestyle questions first:\n<ul>\n \t<li>What prompted the move?<\/li>\n \t<li>What drew you to the downtown life? To apartment life?<\/li>\n \t<li>What stage of life are you in? Career building? Retired? Somewhere in between?<\/li>\n \t<li>Do you like to travel? And if so, how often?<\/li>\n \t<li>How active are you? Are you a runner, hiker, or couch potato?<\/li>\n \t<li>Why do you want a dog?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5002\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/HIking-2-1024x739.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking with a dog, active lifestyle, apartment dog, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartment\" width=\"1024\" height=\"739\" \/>\n\nThere are no wrong answers. Rather, the intent is to identify which aspects of your life are the most important and then determine how Moe will fit in.\n\nDid I forget to mention that I\u2019ve already named your future dog?\n\nAs for how active you are, I am not going to say that as a runner, a Shih Tzu or other small dog is out of the question or that as a couch potato, you shouldn\u2019t consider a lab mix or Standard Poodle. Not at all. While the journey to find the right dog begins with you, once Moe comes home, it\u2019s no longer just about you. Every dog will have needs that must be met\u2014especially when it comes to expending energy\u2014otherwise you may find yourself in a very unhappy, unhealthy relationship.\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BwmcR-3gUty\/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Talk with your family, friends and dog owners. Online, you can find countless articles and sites that might be useful on your quest, but here are four to get you started:\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.winnipeghumanesociety.ca\/adopt\/before-you-adopt\/are-you-ready-for-a-dog\/\">Winnipeg Humane Society: \u201cAre you ready for a dog?\u201d<\/a><\/li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ckc.ca\/en\/Choosing-a-Dog\">Canadian Kennel Club: \u201cChoosing a Dog\u201d<\/a><\/li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/dogtime.com\/matchup\">DogTime\u2019s Dog Matchup tool<\/a><\/li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hillspet.ca\/en-ca\/dog-care\/behavior-appearance\/choosing-the-best-dog-breed-personality\">Hills Pet Nutrition: \u201cDog Breed Personalities: Find the Right Match For You\u201d<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\nNow begins life with Moe.\n<h3>A tired dog is a good dog<\/h3>\nPet store staff can give you recommendations on how to entertain Moe with everything from chews to toys. And if burning off energy at the dog park is in his future, a ball or frisbee might be worth considering. For running and hiking, a comfortable and well-sized harness is a good investment; you can even purchase a comfortable doggy seatbelt for road trips.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_5000\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"768\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-5000\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/IMG_3366-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Dog in a car seat, dog seatbelt, dog harness, apartment dog, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/> Winston, Pug, 1[\/caption]\n\nAnd yes, a bed, for those moments when Moe has finally run out of steam.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much the size of the dog that matters when it comes to apartment living but its excitability, tendency to bark and ability to adapt to smaller spaces. Remember that you are living in a community, and Moe needs to walk the hallways, meet your neighbours, and take the elevator when he\u2019s not lounging in your apartment.\n\nInvest some time in training Moe to be a great canine neighbour. Yes, there is work involved but, it is well worth it. Both you and Moe will be thankful for having done it.\n<h3>Green spaces and dog-friendly parks<\/h3>\nWinnipeg has many green spaces and trails within a short distance from the downtown core. From Waterfront Drive and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theforks.com\/\">The Forks<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.assiniboinepark.ca\/\">Assiniboine Park<\/a>, you and Moe have plenty of options to get out and explore!\n\n<center><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1477463672396161&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"510\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/center>The city operates 11 off-leash dog parks, one of which is right downtown.

It\u2019s safely fenced in and features artificial turf, perfect for dog paws to run around on.

Visit the city of Winnipeg website for a <a href=\"https:\/\/winnipeg.ca\/publicworks\/parksOpenSpace\/OffLeashDogParks\/default.stm\">list of all off-leash dog areas<\/a>.\n<h3>There\u2019s no love like the love of a dog<\/h3>\nAs a dog owner myself, much of what I\u2019ve said comes from personal experience. I could probably write a book about life with my pets over the years. Brandy (since passed away), a Shih Tzu, explored the eastern states from the green mountains of Vermont to the island of Nantucket in Massachusetts in a pink stroller because she didn\u2019t like to walk. Alice, our Standard Poodle and an aspiring writer, is busy putting together her own coffee table book of decorating accomplishments. Alice and I can often be found at the Charleswood dog park with Winnie, a Bearded Collie. Woof, woof!\n\n<strong><em>Have any questions about living the apartment life with your furry friend?

Classes usually run Monday to Friday from 12 to 1 pm. Visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/downtownwinnipegbiz.com\/programs-services\/events\/fitnessinthepark\/\">Downtown Biz website<\/a> for details and an up-to-date schedule. These classes are free; just bring your yoga mat!\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/mbwpg.cmha.ca\/events\/free-yoga-and-meditation-tuesdays-and-thursdays-2019-06-25\/\"><strong>Yoga and meditation with Cian<\/strong><\/a>\n930 Portage Avenue\n\nEvery Tuesday from 6 to 7 pm, Cian\u2014a trained yogi\u2014hosts a free yoga and meditation session for Winnipeggers of all levels of experience. The event is first come, first serve with only 20 spots available, so show up early to grab a spot!\n\n<strong><em>My recommendation<\/em><\/strong>\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of group classes, or just want to get your yogi on solo, downtown Winnipeg has beautiful parks where you can lay out your mat. One of my favourite quiet places is <a href=\"https:\/\/downtownwinnipegbiz.com\/business\/stephen-juba-park\/\">Stephen Juba Park<\/a>, right waterfront in the Exchange district. If you are looking for a quieter yoga session, try going early in the morning.\n<h3>Where can I find a few minutes of silence?<\/h3>\nWhether you\u2019re looking for a peaceful place to study or somewhere quiet to relax, downtown Winnipeg has got your back!\n\n<strong>Millennium Library\n<\/strong>251 Donald Street\n\nA library is the most obvious place to look when craving a bit of silence, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/wpl.winnipeg.ca\/library\/branchpages\/branch.aspx?mill\">Millennium Library<\/a> stands out among Winnipeg\u2019s libraries. Spread on each side of a massive staircase, the study area is a designated \u201cquiet zone.\u201d At any point in the day, you\u2019ll find people working in complete silence. This area is also beautiful, with simple design that won\u2019t distract you from your work and enormous windows that stand from floor to ceiling. Natural light fills the area and it\u2019s a wonderful place to find a few moments of peace.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.mb.ca\/chc\/leg-lib\/\"><strong>Legislative Library<\/strong><\/a>\n200 Vaughan Street\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BjgRSZElbTB\/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

And, given that Smith is a popular spot not only for breakfast but dinner and the after-dinner crowd as well, its appeal transcends the morning hours. Let\u2019s call it <em>Canadiana<\/em> fusion, with wood features, modern lighting, leather and benches covered in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebay.com\/\">Hudson\u2019s Bay<\/a> point blankets.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_5361\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-5361\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_3730-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast, Smith Restaurant, Inn at The Forks, The Forks, Meet Me At The Forks, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Living Winnipeg, Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Restaurants, Downtown Winnipeg Restaurants, Where To Eat Winnipeg Downtown\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/> Inside the Smith Restaurant[\/caption]\n<h3>The service<\/h3>\nProfessional and yet personable fits the service to a tee. From the host, who was unfazed when we showed up early for our reservation, to our server Angela, with whom we shared a few good laughs. The service matched the situation and exceeded our expectations.\n<h3>The menu<\/h3>\n\u201cNot your mama\u2019s eggs\u201d comes to mind when describing the menu. Not that there is anything wrong with her eggs, but Smith\u2019s chefs have succeeded in creating a menu that features local, seasonal, and Canadian products, which really bumps those eggs up to the next level. Sure, you can order the Hotel Breakfast\u2014which consists of some good old-fashioned eggs with a choice of bacon or sausage\u2014or oatmeal (with a Saskatoon berry twist), but there are a few more interesting options.\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BtbGNNzgKD6\/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It might be the Scandinavian blood in me, but the Eggs Copenhagen called, and I was not disappointed. Two poached eggs with smoked lox and r\u00f6sti potato came together nicely. Of course, no breakfast would be complete without a good cup of tea or coffee, and here, too, we pleasantly surprised.\n\nIn addition to the usual selection of teas, cappuccino, espresso, and Americano coffees, Smith offers a French press coffee option. We gave the French press a try, and it was exquisite.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to kick off your day with some good food, give Smith a try. Perhaps you, too, will find that it has that <em>je ne sais quoi<\/em>.\n\nFeedback on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.ca\/Restaurant_Review-g154954-d7078344-Reviews-Smith_Restaurant-Winnipeg_Manitoba.html\">TripAdvisor rates Smith a four out of five<\/a> with \u201cvalue\u201d having the lowest rating.

		"content": "Cleaning your home naturally is no more difficult that cleaning it with harsh chemicals. In fact, homemade cleaning supplies are better for your wallet, last longer, and help keep toxins out of your downtown oasis! Here are some of my favourite homemade cleaning supply formulas.\n\n<em><strong>Let\u2019s start with where the most messes appear: the kitchen.<\/strong><\/em>\n<h3>All-Purpose Cleaner<\/h3>\n\u00bd cup white vinegar 2 tablespoons baking soda 10 drops tea tree, lavender, or lemon essential oil (for their disinfectant properties)\n\nMix the vinegar, essential oils and a little water before adding baking soda in a clean spray bottle (glass is best). Fill to the top with water. I use about a 12-ounce bottle. Gently shake to mix the ingredients, and then spray, wipe with a cloth, and allow to dry.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2955\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png\" alt=\"dirty dishes, dirty kitchen, messy kitchen. apartment living, living with roommates, roomies, winnipeg apartments, 300 Main apartments, downtown winnipeg, natural cleaning products, winnipeg, downtown living, cleaning products winnipeg\" width=\"1021\" height=\"694\" \/>\n<h3>Liquid Dish Soap<\/h3>\n\u00bd cup distilled water\n\n1 tablespoon white vinegar\n\n\u00bd cup Sal Suds (find it at most health food stores or Walmart)\n\n1 tablespoon moisturizing oil, such as coconut or olive\n\nPour the water and vinegar into a bottle. Shake to mix, and then add the Sal Suds and oil. Gently shake the bottle again to combine the ingredients.\n<h3>Homemade Drain Cleaner<\/h3>\n\u00bd cup baking soda\n\n\u00bc cup white vinegar\n\nSprinkle baking soda down the clogged or smelly drain, then pour in the vinegar. Let the bubbling mixture sit for an hour or so, then pour boiling hot water down the drain to rinse. Depending on how clogged the drain is, you may need to repeat the process. If you clean your drain regularly, you\u2019ll find that one dose will keep things clear.\n\n<strong><em>Now let\u2019s move on to the bathroom!<\/em><\/strong>\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5456\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade cleaning products, natural cleaning products, cleaning products winnipeg, winnipeg apartment living, downtown winnipeg living, apartment living\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>Tub and Tile Cleaner<\/h3>\n12 ounces white vinegar\n\n12 ounces dish soap (I usually use Dawn)\n\nHeat vinegar in the microwave until hot and then pour into the spray bottle. Add the dish soap, put the lid on, gently shake and you are ready to clean! To get rid of soap scum, spray the mixture on and leave it to sit overnight.\n<h3>Toilet Cleaner <em>(This is going to sound a bit odd. Just hear me out!)<\/em><\/h3>\n1 can Coca Cola\n\n1 cup baking soda\n\n1 cup white distilled vinegar\n\nDump the Coca Cola into the toilet and let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then flush. Add the vinegar and the baking soda to the toilet next (without stirring or scrubbing) and wait until the mixture stops bubbling. Scrub any tough stains, otherwise just flush and you\u2019re done! The soda and the vinegar\/baking-soda mixture will also help to keep the pipes clear of buildup.\n\n<em><strong>But what about carpets or stinky smells that linger around your house?<\/strong><\/em>\n<h3>Homemade Air Freshener<\/h3>\n15 drops pure essential oil (grapefruit and lavender are my favourite!)\n\n\u00bd cup white vinegar\n\n\u00bd cup water\n\nCombine ingredients in a spray bottle and shake. Spray liberally around your home to freshen things up!\n<h3>Carpet Cleaner<\/h3>\n1 cup white vinegar\n\n2 cups water 2 teaspoons salt 15 drops lavender essential oil or another clear, pure essential oil of choice\n\nCombine vinegar and water in a large spray bottle. Add in salt and lavender essential oil; close the cap and shake bottle. Spray on carpets where needed and allow carpets to air-dry. Once dry, vacuum the treated areas and enjoy a carpet that looks brand-spanking new!\n\n<em><strong>And finally, the laundry room.<\/strong><\/em>\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5460\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/laundry-4017609_1920-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade cleaning products, natural cleaning products, cleaning products winnipeg, winnipeg apartment living, downtown winnipeg living, apartment living\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>Liquid Laundry Detergent<\/h3>\n\u00bd cup Borax\n\n\u00bd cup washing soda (I use Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Soda Laundry Booster)\n\n\u00bd cup Dawn dish soap\n\n4 cups hot water\n\nCombine the Borax, washing soda, and Dawn soap into a clean, empty gallon plastic jug (use a funnel to get it all in without a mess). Fill the container to the top with cold water to help the ingredients to dissolve.

		"content": "Downtown Winnipeg is known for having the most frigid intersection in the city at Portage and Main, heritage buildings in Exchange District, beautiful blooming trees on the Manitoba legislature grounds, and art galleries. It\u2019s also known for its selection of unique, classy coffee shops. Downtown coffee shops don\u2019t just serve espresso drinks to get you through the day; they also offer a cozy, relaxing place to unwind.\n\nI\u2019ve explored coffee shops in downtown Winnipeg from Main Street to Broadway, proving there are many satisfying options for holding meetings, working, chatting, or just spending quality time alone with a good book. When people ask me what to do in Winnipeg or where they can grab a good cup of coffee, I say two magic words: <em>Forth<\/em> and <em>Parlour<\/em>. Of course, those are just the highlights\u2060\u2014here are five options for where to get your caffeine fix downtown.\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.foolsandhorses.ca\/\">Fools &amp; Horses <\/a><\/h3>\nThis coffee shop is located at 379 Broadway (plus another location at the Forks), and you can imagine how busy it gets. During the lunch rush, you\u2019re lucky if you manage to snag a seat. To keep pace, the staff is very energetic and friendly. I won\u2019t bother mentioning that they have great coffee\u2060\u2014obviously they do, or this place wouldn\u2019t be on the list! Instead, I want to highlight the interior. My forever-favourite part about Fools and Horses is the humongous wooden table right in the middle of the shop. The table is surrounded by mint and silver iron chairs, which are usually filled with students. I can\u2019t count how many random but totally pleasant chats I\u2019ve while sitting there, sipping a delicious cappuccino.\n\n<center><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffoolswpg%2Fposts%2F882303228629504&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"604\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/parlourcoffee.ca\/\">Parlour<\/a><\/h3>\nThe first thing that literally hit my eye when I walked into tiny Parlour was the writing on the wall. <em>\u201cNo Wi-Fi. Talk to your neighbour.\u201d<\/em> I was amazed to see my own philosophy of old-fashioned communication reflected in a coffee shop. That day, I got a cup of hot chocolate, a croissant, and walked out having decided to become a regular customer at 468 Main Street. The shop itself is small, but very cozy. They don\u2019t have the usual tables and chairs, just wooden bar chairs and counters lining the walls and window. Grab a spot by the window for the best view of Main Street. Thanks to their friendly baristas, welcoming atmosphere and high-quality coffee, you\u2019ll find an impeccable place to hide from the rain with a good book or for a chat with a stranger.\n\n<center><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fparlourcoffee%2Fposts%2F2492837500767216%3A0&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"490\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thombargen.com\/\">Thom Bargen<\/a><\/h3>\nThom Bargen has two locations in Winnipeg, but I love the caf\u00e9 at 250 Kennedy Street. Thom Bargen is the only place in Winnipeg that serves <a href=\"https:\/\/philsebastian.com\/\">Phil &amp; Sebastian coffee<\/a> beans. If you\u2019re a coffee lover like myself, you\u2019ll appreciate the selection Thom Bargen offers. They also feature special guest roasters that change monthly. My favourites so far have been Monogram and Anchored.\n\n<center><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FDowntownPeggy%2Fposts%2F2500409343313725&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"681\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/center>Thom Bargen is also known for its beautiful tiny marble tables, and prime location in a beautiful part of downtown. The caf\u00e9 is framed by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rwb.org\/\">Royal Winnipeg Ballet<\/a> on one side, and a small bookshop that has a huge selection of old and rare editions on the other. The Kennedy location also has the most Instagram-worthy plant wall! It makes the caf\u00e9 feel fresh and summery on even the coldest days.\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stellas.ca\/\">Stella\u2019s<\/a><\/h3>\nWhile not technically a coffee shop, Stella\u2019s deserves a mention when discussing coffee in downtown Winnipeg. The Stella\u2019s location at 110 Sherbrook is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stellas.ca\/bakery\/\">bakery<\/a>-plus-restaurant combo across two buildings. While I highly recommend the restaurant for breakfast or lunch, today I want to highlight the bakery. Step inside, take in a breath of air warm with freshly baked bread, order a latte and chocolate croissant, and nestle in at one of the tiny wooden tables in the corner. The bakery feels meant for quiet conversations or a quick getaway from responsibilities. A word of advice: When hunting for a chocolate croissant, make sure to get there in the morning. The famous pastries at Stella\u2019s fly out the door as soon as they open.\n\n<center><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FStellascafebakery%2Fposts%2F2142578272457783%3A0&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"614\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/forth_wpg\/\">Forth<\/a><\/h3>\nI saved the most unique and loved caf\u00e9 for last. Forth is known for its square wooden tables, plants, and stand of newspapers from different cities. It\u2019s also beloved for its rooftop patio, which offers amazing views from May to October (weather permitting). You can see both the modern part of downtown and the heritage buildings of the Exchange District. The contrast is breathtaking.\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5583\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_2441-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Coffee Shops In Downtown Winnipeg, downtown Winnipeg, winnipeg cafe, winnipeg coffee shops, downtown winnipeg coffee shops, coffee shops in the exchange district, exchange district, coffee in exchange district, exchange district coffee\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n\nForth doesn\u2019t just serve espresso drinks. They serve a small menu of snacks, salads, and some alcoholic beverages. The rooftop bar is the most stylish and minimalist-looking bar I\u2019ve seen in Winnipeg. When you visit, indulge in the avocado toast, as it will just melt on your tongue. The shop is in a historical building at 171 McDermot. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhs.mb.ca\/docs\/sites\/dawsonrichardsonbuilding.shtml\">Dawson Richardson Building<\/a> was built in 1921 to become the Grain Trade News publishing house. When inside, you might feel you can still catch the smell of old typographical papers and hear the click-clack of typewriter keys.\n\n<em><strong>Let us know about your favourite downtown Winnipeg coffee shop.

		"content": "My kitchen is tiny. So tiny that guests will walk through it and ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of it?\u201d But I don\u2019t let the size of my kitchen make me shy away from cooking! I\u2019m a foodie, but most importantly, a foodie on a budget\u2014so I cook most of my meals at home.\n<h3><em>Why I Love Cooking<\/em><\/h3>\nOver the years, I\u2019ve fallen in love with cooking. I walk into my kitchen and the possibilities feel endless! My favourite way to cook is with no plan or recipe. In the kitchen there are no rules, and I love that. In school, work, and even my hobbies I always feel pressure to be creative in a certain way; but cooking is a different kind of creativity, and I can create without limitations!\n\nAnd because I love cooking so much, I don\u2019t let my small kitchen prevent me from cooking up a storm. Here are some of my favourite ways to use my space!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5630\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Small kitchen, Organizing Kitchen, 300 Main Apartments, Kitchen Interiors, Kitchen Clutter, Kitchen utensils\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/>\n<h3>1. Stacking<\/h3>\nStacking is your best friend with a tiny kitchen. My kitchen is what some might call an organized mess. As soon as you walk into my space, you\u2019re greeted by my microwave underneath my coffee maker, which is tucked up against my slow cooker, which has three cookbooks stacked neatly on top. Small kitchens usually don\u2019t have room for much horizontal space, but what about vertical space? Start by stacking items that you don\u2019t tend to grab as much, and then stack items that you frequently use together. Not only will you save space, but you\u2019ll also know which stack to pull things from when you\u2019re in a time crunch rather than running around trying to find your food processer or a cookbook.\n<h3>2. Clean as You Go<\/h3>\nCleaning as you go is a crucial habit for cooking in a small space. You cannot use your space to its fullest potential with pots and food scrapes taking over half of your counter space! This tip is basic, but a total game changer.\n\n<center><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1497982703677591&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"573\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n<h3>3. Use ALL Your Space<\/h3>\nUtilizing all your space is also a key component to enlarging your kitchen. Try placing a cutting board over your stove top or an open drawer. Use your kitchen table as a prep space or place one of your larger cutting boards over your sink to make extra counter space. Get creative. Just because it isn\u2019t a countertop doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t function like one!\n<h3>4. Look Up for Utensil Storage<\/h3>\nStore your utensils up high! I\u2019m very particular about where my utensils go. I recommend that anyone who does a lot of cooking in a small kitchen store their most used utensils, pots, and pans on hooks. If possible, a shallow cubby is a great space to store utensils. I find it very stressful to rifle through drawers in search of my whisk or a medium frying pan. By displaying a few of your most crucial cooking tools, you set yourself up for success!\n\n<center><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1510041235805071&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"491\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n<h3><em>Kitchen Appliances I Can Vouch For<\/em><\/h3>\nEvery birthday and holiday, it seems like a new kitchen appliance is at the top of my list! Here are some of my favourite kitchen appliances that are a must for those of us with limited space.\n\n<strong>Mini Food Processor<\/strong>\n\nA mini food processor is an essential! Not only is this contraption small, but it\u2019s also a great tool for chopping up food quickly. It saves you so much counter space over clunky cutting boards.\n\n<strong>Slow Cooker<\/strong>\n\nSlow cookers solve all our problems, honestly. They\u2019re a necessity for those who dread coming home and cooking dinner after their 9-to-5. Just pop in your ingredients in the morning, leave it for the day and boom, a hot meal to welcome you home!\n\n<strong>Coffee Maker<\/strong>\n\nA good ol\u2019 coffee maker is a must for us downtowners\u2014it\u2019s just a way of life! I have both a coffee maker and an espresso maker, but coffee for me is a lifestyle more than a drink. I think a standard coffee maker is a necessity for all kitchens. Nowadays, they\u2019re so compact they don\u2019t take up much room in your kitchen.\n\n<strong>Rolling Cart<\/strong>\n\nWhile not exactly an appliance, a rolling cart is life-changing! I bought mine from Ikea for $35, but the amount of use I get out of it makes it priceless in my book. I mainly use it to store ingredients and utensils that I need while cooking but don\u2019t have the counter space for. The best part is, once I am done with it I can roll it into a corner and it\u2019s out of my way!\n\n<em><strong>Got any other small kitchen tips and tricks?

With the \u201cLiving Living Room\u201d, Erica combined her landscape architecture training and her passion for sculpture with the idea to create household objects made purely of the earth. By combining a creative art display with an environmentally-conscious gardening, this piece enriches the human experience creatively and collectively. Erica made the living room garden a beautiful piece of art that people can really connect with.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_5753\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"720\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/winnipegarts.ca\/wac\/artwork\/living-living-room\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5753\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/NI8ugsmh-720-478.jpg\" alt=\"Public Arts Winnipeg, Public Arts, Arts, Living Living Room, Winnipeg Arts Council, Winnipeg Arts, Winnipeg Downtown, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" \/><\/a> Orioles Community Centre, living living room by Erica Swendrowski \u2014 Photo by Robert Tinker[\/caption]\n\nIn her proposal for the project, Erica wrote, \u201cFor generations, community gardens have provided city dwellers with opportunities to grow healthy food close to home.\u201d Erica\u2019s \u201cliving living rooms\u201d were integrated into community gardens at the <a href=\"http:\/\/valourcc.ca\/facilities\/orioles\/\">Orioles Community Centre<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/lordrobertscc.ca\/\">Lord Roberts Community Centre<\/a>, and the Millennium Garden. The project\u2019s ambitions were to connect local gardeners and to help new relationships \u201cblossom\u201d.\n\nWhen I first saw the piece, I was in awe of Erica\u2019s ability to create something that felt so familiar. Living rooms are places of comfort, where we gather with friends and family; they\u2019re filled with memories of holidays, parties and cuddling up to watch your favourite tv shows. Building something that feels so homey encourages people to feel welcomed. I think that sense of togetherness probably made more people want to participate in up-keeping the community gardens where Erica built her creations.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_5754\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"720\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/winnipegarts.ca\/wac\/artwork\/living-living-room\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5754\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/3BZHoy2N-720-478.jpg\" alt=\"Public Arts Winnipeg, Public Arts, Arts, Living Living Room, Winnipeg Arts Council, Winnipeg Arts, Winnipeg Downtown, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" \/><\/a> Garden Bus Tour, West Broadway, living living room by Erica Swendrowski \u2014 Photo by Robert Tinker[\/caption]\n\nI also appreciate the creative relationship between the traditionally-shaped living room \u201cfurniture\u201d and the earthy materials and tones. As a place to spend time together, living rooms are a central part of our homes. The natural materials of these pieces remind us that ultimately, the earth is the home we all share.\n\nIn Winnipeg, we\u2019re lucky to have green spaces throughout the city. I hope these pieces helped those who saw them connect with the idea of how important it is to take care of the environment.\n\n<em><strong>You can <a href=\"http:\/\/winnipegarts.ca\/pubart-about\">learn more about the Public Art Program<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/winnipegarts.ca\/wac\/pubart-gal\/\">view all the public artworks<\/a> on the Winnipeg Art Council\u2019s website.

		"content": "I spent almost 20 years living in apartments before moving into a house, and they were good years. I moved into my first apartment as a teenager with my parents to save money, but there were many reasons why I stuck with apartments for so long.\n<h3>Location, location, location<\/h3>\nI\u2019ve lived in multiple cities and provinces, and my biggest reason for sticking with apartment living was always location and the convenience it brought. I\u2019m not a driver, so I like to be in or near downtown areas where buses are plentiful and I can walk to lots of places. I spent years being able to walk to work in less than 20 minutes, and I loved it. Walking is cheap, lets you avoid rush-hour frustration, and is an easy way to get exercise outdoors. (And yes, I still walked to work in Winnipeg winters. The trick is bundling up properly, and I\u2019ll take that over +30\u2103 weather any day.)\n\nhttps:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible\/\n\nIt was also nice to be able to walk to the grocery store, coffee shops, and restaurants. Going to a concert downtown? No problem. I strolled right past the line-ups of cars trying to leave the venue. I was often home before most cars had been able to move two blocks. And when I lived in Osborne Village, I had several friends who lived in the neighbourhood, so get-togethers were a cinch.\n<h3>Not handy? No problem<\/h3>\nAnother thing I loved about apartment living was not worrying about upkeep. I am the opposite of handy, so it helped that the most I ever had to do was reset a breaker. If something broke, such as the air conditioner or stove, I didn\u2019t have to fix it or pay to replace it. I also never had to cut grass or shovel snow. I truly miss my shoveling-free days.\n\nhttps:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/rent-vs-buy-which-is-right-for-you\/\n<h3>Community atmosphere<\/h3>\nI also liked the safety and sense of community I felt in an apartment building. I didn\u2019t always know my neighbours, but sometimes I made friends and it was nice to have people to say \u201chello\u201d to on my way in or out. Being a single woman for many of those years, I always felt safer in a secure building with neighbours within earshot. Being alone at night in a house (particularly if it was a large house) always brought out the worst in my imagination.\n\nhttps:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/new-to-networking-start-with-your-neighbours\/\n<h3>Nice and easy<\/h3>\nI\u2019ve done quite a lot of moving around, and apartments were ideal for that too. I never had to worry about selling a house or what the market was like when it came time to move. I just gave my necessary notice and was off.\n\nI\u2019ve always liked having a smaller place, too. (Even my house is small.) I like not having to furnish lots of rooms, and more importantly, I hate having to clean a big place. I could clean any of my apartments in less than an hour, so I didn\u2019t waste my precious time on dreaded housework.\n<h3>The one downside<\/h3>\nMy only beef about some of my apartments (always the older buildings) was when I had no control over the heat in winter. Those apartments were always too warm for my liking. In my last apartment, butter would half-melt on the counter because it was so hot! For this reason, I recommend looking for a relatively new building where you can control your own thermostat.\n<h3>Bottom line<\/h3>\n<strong>Overall, there\u2019s so much to like about apartment living that I\u2019m surprised more people don\u2019t try it. They\u2019re missing out! What\u2019s your favourite aspect of apartment living?<\/strong>",

Manitoba summers bring beautiful weather, and there is no shortage of things to do outside while soaking up the sun and staying active. With scenic architecture, beautiful trails, green parks, and tons of events, downtown is full things to see while you stay active this summer.\n<h3>Follow the Riverwalk<\/h3>\nOne of my favorite things about downtown is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.travelmanitoba.com\/listings\/the-forks-historic-port-and-riverwalk\/6764\/\">riverwalk<\/a>. Winnipeg is famous for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theforks.com\/events\/river-trail\">skating trail<\/a> in the winter, which is among the longest in Canada, but you don\u2019t need to wait for the ice to freeze to enjoy the sights. The river trail is a beautiful, accessible path that winds alongside our river. It takes about 15 minutes to walk the path as it stretches through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.osbornevillage.com\/\">Osborne Village<\/a> and surrounds The Forks. It\u2019s a gorgeous choice for a weekend stroll, and practical enough for your daily commute!\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bs9Mei2jg8C\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Sit down dining not really your thing? Check out downtown <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tourismwinnipeg.com\/eat-and-drink\/peg-city-grub\/read,post\/881\/2019-winnipeg-food-truck-guide\">Winnipeg\u2019s many food trucks<\/a> this summer! With a surprising amount of variety and high-quality dishes, it\u2019ll make you rethink street food. Don\u2019t forget to check back at the end of summer for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.manyfest.ca\/events\/food-truck-wars\/\">Manyfest<\/a> (Food Truck Wars). This year\u2019s competition runs from September 6 to 8, which is arguably the end of the food truck season for Winnipeg.\n<h3>Soak up the Arts in the Exchange District<\/h3>\n<strong>Reggae Fest<\/strong>\nIn July, Winnipeg hosts the Winnipeg <a href=\"https:\/\/srfwpg.blogspot.com\/\">Soca Reggae Festival<\/a>. This is one for your summer to-do list for sure! Catch the festival downtown at Winnipeg favourite, <a href=\"https:\/\/exchangedistrict.org\/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square\/\">The Cube Stage<\/a>. Reggae Fest is just one of many unique festivals that happens in the Exchange District every summer.\n\n<strong>The Fringe Festival<\/strong>\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.winnipegfringe.com\/\">Fringe Festival<\/a> takes over the Exchange District every summer. With shows happening at The Cube Stage and other locations downtown, every day of The Fringe is a new experience! Packed full of live entertainment from over 170 different theatre companies, local and visiting talent, live bands and beer gardens, the Fringe Festival is a week of comedy, drama, music, art, and passion.\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1494330944042767&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"713\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n<h3>Enjoy the Nightlife<\/h3>\nDowntown Winnipeg has a huge variety of options when it comes to clubs, bars, gaming, and live music. Between the throbbing nightclubs and laid-back bars, you\u2019re bound to have a great time anywhere you go. In a city so full of live music and things to do, it can be hard to choose where to go\u2060\u2014but The Good Will Social Club and Forth Caf\u00e9 are two of my favourites.\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/thegoodwill.ca\/\">The Good Will Social Club<\/a><\/h3>\nThe Good Will is located at 625 Portage Avenue, near the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uwinnipeg.ca\/\">University of Winnipeg<\/a>. At first glance, it looks like an okay option to stop for a beer, and you\u2019d be right\u2060\u2014but it\u2019s so much more than that! The Good Will often features DJs, bands, and karaoke. Once upon a time, I took part in a spelling \u201cbeer\u201d there! Check out their online calendar to see what they\u2019ve got going on.\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forth.ca\/\">Forth Caf\u00e9<\/a><\/h3>\nDuring the day this charming caf\u00e9 at 171 McDermot Avenue is a great place for coffee and cocktails. However, this caf\u00e9 has a not-so-secret secret: an intimate bar downstairs and a roof-top patio with views of the Exchange. The caf\u00e9 closes at 10:00 pm during the week, but the bar and roof-top patio are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forth.ca\/\">open late<\/a>.\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BwR7W2UAyqU\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

		"content": "Last summer, when whiteout parties were taking over whole blocks of downtown Winnipeg and all I saw were people in stylized white outfits, I knew there would be a white night I'd enjoy more in a few months. As an artist, poet and photographer, my favorite night of the year is always <a href=\"https:\/\/nuitblanchewinnipeg.ca\/\">Nuit Blanche<\/a>.\n\nhttps:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-event\/nuit-blanche-2019\/\n\nI often wonder where I\u2019ll end up when Nuit Blanche finally arrives. There are a lot of options, and I find myself wondering where I should go on the longest night of art exhibitions in the city. Luckily, I didn't have to worry about that for very long this year because friends of mine already had plans in place to start off the night.\n<h3>Slam! All-Star Poets Compete For Your Scores!<\/h3>\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thombargen.com\/\">Thom Bargen Coffee and Tea<\/a><\/strong>\n\nHaving been a member of the spoken word community for a long time, I was pleased to be asked to perform at Winnipeg Poetry Slam\u2019s Nuit Blanche event. I was also part of the Winnipeg Poetry Slam team for 2018, which later competed in the National Poetry Slam in Guelph, part of the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word.\n\nFor Nuit Blanche, seven of us poets got together, and we gave art lovers a show to start off the night! It was a great opportunity for me because I was able to introduce new friends of mine to the spoken word community; they'd never been to a poetry slam before and had no idea what to expect. I find that these are often the best minds to have at a poetry slam, as they're the most receptive and will get the most out of the poetry itself. With a small group of artists, poets, and other art enthusiasts in tow, I started us off on our journey through Nuit Blanche. Here are a few of the installations we saw as we ventured forth into the night.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fvideos%2F171998770396697%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.winnipegfreepress.com\/our-communities\/metro\/Whimsical-art-piece-a-first-for-Wolseley-artist-493489791.html\">\"Hand of the Machine\" by Solmund MacPherson<\/a><\/h3>\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/wpl.winnipeg.ca\/library\/branchpages\/branch.aspx?mill\">Millennium Library<\/a> Courtyard<\/strong>\n\nPhoto courtesy of Nuit Blanche Winnipeg. Situated next to another installation (\u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/winnipegarts.ca\/wac\/artwork\/emptyful\">emptyful<\/a>\u201d) in the courtyard behind the Millennium Library was our first installation of the night: a massive and well-lit hand stretching out into the night air, with control levers that moved the fingers. In some cases, interactive art installations are built to last. But by the time we arrived, about an hour and a half into Nuit Blanche, the middle finger was broken and hanging limp in the middle of the palm. While we were there, I also saw the installation fall forward more than once, like a wrestler trying to tap out. Instead, someone picked it up and put it back into the fight. Before leaving we grabbed a few free books from the assortment the library had set up, and I played a game of oversized Connect 4.\n<h3>\"No, I've never herd of bison\" by Kale Bonham and Todd Scott<\/h3>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.upperfortgarry.com\/\"><strong>Upper Fort Garry Provincial Park<\/strong><\/a>\n\n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fphotos%2Fa.1673473746070347%2F2146671585417225%2F%3Ftype%3D3&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"535\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n\nTo be honest, I don't think I appreciated this installation enough. It was a group of sound-activated bison next to the illumination board that lines the back side of Upper Fort Garry Park. When we got there, there wasn't much noise to trigger the bison to react, so we moved on quickly. However, I've since seen images of the installation reacting to crowds of people, and it looks quite interesting!\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/woodanchor.com\/img_0496\/\">\"Run For Your Lite\" by Wood Anchor and Cloverdale Forge<\/a><\/h3>\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tourismwinnipeg.com\/things-to-do\/attractions\/display,listing\/05735\/esplanade-riel-pedestrian-bridge\">Esplanade Riel bridge<\/a> landing<\/strong>\n\nAfter a stop in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theforks.com\/attractions\/the-forks-market\">The Forks Market<\/a> to grab a bite to eat and a coffee, we moved on to the next few installations, but none caught my eye like this one. You could see the installation for what it was: Free energy. It took the form of a large wooden \"hamster wheel\" with a handle bar to grip, covered with lights and connected to turbines that would not only illuminate the installation but also power a nearby forge. The crowd was as loud as the machine itself, shouting support to friends who decided to try their hand at powering the forge!\n\n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1895361463881573%3A0&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"622\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n\nWe sat and watched people compete to see who could keep running the longest, all the while drawing cheers of support from onlookers. It seemed like 5 to 8 minutes was the best folks could handle before the momentum started making them slip or lose their balance. It was definitely entertaining to watch as we ate the food we bought (seating inside was impossible to find) before walking up to Waterfront to move on to the Exchange District.\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/connectingcities.net\/project\/control-no-control\">\"Control No Control\" by Daniel Iregui<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.winnipegarchitecture.ca\/shipping-container-exhibit\/\">\"Container Architecture\" by Winnipeg Architecture Foundation<\/a><\/h3>\n<strong>Bijou Park, East of Old Market Square<\/strong>\n\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/57144334\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\n\nSetup alongside Old Market Square, Bijou Park (which hosts Kids Fringe activities during the summer festival) hosted two displays during this year's Nuit Blanche. On one side of the park, \"Control No Control\" featured a massive LED panel that reacted to both touch and sound input from the ever-growing crowd around it. On the other side of the park, nestled up to the side of Smoke's Poutinerie, the Winnipeg Architecture Foundation set up a converted shipping container. It featured various other architectural projects around the world, showcasing the use of shipping containers as raw materials to build sustainable structures and housing. As a big supporter of sustainable living initiatives, this struck home with me.\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/winnipegarts.ca\/wac\/artwork\/impulse\">\"Impulse\" presented by The Winnipeg Arts Council<\/a><\/h3>\n<strong>Old Market Square<\/strong>\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZRG4PMlY38Y\" width=\"324\" height=\"415\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\n\nOne of the biggest installations I\u2019ve seen, \"Impulse\" was a collection of massive light-beam seesaws for riders of all ages. No matter how many videos or pictures I tried to take of this spectacle, none could do it justice. Every face in Old Market Square that night was filled with excitement and exhilaration!\n\nThere were many other ways for everyone to enjoy Nuit Blanche last year, including community events, gallery shows, and live exhibitions throughout the night. I hope my memories of Nuit Blanche have inspired you to make some memories of your own this year!\n\n<em><strong>Mark September 28 in your calendar, and share your favourite Nuit Blanche memories in the comments!<\/strong><\/em>",

		"content": "Isn\u2019t it funny how the air changes when August rolls around, chased by September? I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actual science behind that, but in my mind, it\u2019s a fact.\n\nThe days can still be hot and sunny, but the sun rises later, the mornings are cooler and a 10 pm sunset is a distant memory. It\u2019s too early to think about winter, and definitely too early to give up on enjoying a Winnipeg summer.\n\nAnd to me, that means continuing to spend as much time as possible outdoors, enjoying picnics! Yes, you heard me right: good, old-fashioned picnics. Winnipeg makes it easy as, with abundant public parks and green spaces where you can spread your picnic blanket. Most Winnipeg parks are open from 7 am to 10 pm.\n\nHere is my list of four parks in Winnipeg that should be at the top of your picnic list!\n<h3>Bruce Park<\/h3>\n<em>1966 Portage Ave.<\/em>\n\nTruth be told, I never knew that Bruce Park existed until a friend told me! The embarrassing part is that I have driven by this park countless times. It just goes to show how often we don\u2019t really notice what is right there in front of us.\n\nSitting on 4.4 hectares of land south of Portage Avenue, and just east of the Assiniboine Park foot bridge, Bruce Park offers a number of options for picnickers. It has a few tables, a few well-placed benches, and plenty of space to roll out a blanket.\n\n<strong>Appeal:<\/strong> Quiet refuge away from the hustle and bustle of downtown life.\n\n\u2022 Parking access is available from the lane that borders the park to the west.\n\n\u2022 Washroom facilities only available when the pool is open.\n<h3>Crescent Drive Park<\/h3>\n<em>781 Crescent Drive<\/em>\n\nThere are so many reasons to love this park. From the wildlife that shares its space, to the Red River that passes it by. Wildlife, you ask? In addition to birds and squirrels, a number of deer call Crescent Drive Park home. There\u2019s also a monarch butterfly garden nearby. Visit at the right time of year, and you may find yourself being entertained by these little beauties.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_5840\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-5840\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Crescent-Drive-Park-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/> Crescent Drive Park, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Appeal:<\/strong> Natural setting along the Red River, close to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thermea.ca\/\">Therm\u00eba<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/winnipeg.ca\/golf\/crescent.stm\">Crescent Drive Golf Course<\/a>.\n\n\u2022 Plenty of parking.\n\n\u2022 BBQ pits available.\n\n\u2022 Portable toilets provided while a new picnic shelter and washroom facilities being rebuilt.\n<h3>La Barri\u00e8re Park<\/h3>\n<em>4403 Waverley St.<\/em>\n\nWhile not technically in Winnipeg, La Barri\u00e8re Park is just too good to leave off this list!\n\nI first fell in love with La Barri\u00e8re Park in winter because it\u2019s a great place to walk my dogs. It now calls to me year-round, with or without the dogs. Its trails lead you over the La Salle River and through a mature forest where you can run, jog, or walk. The slow-moving La Salle River is quite popular with paddlers. My camera also professes a love for this park, and always finds something to capture.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_5841\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-5841 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Labarriere-Park-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/> La Barriere Park, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Appeal:<\/strong> Proximity to the city and variety of picnic settings to choose from.\n\n\u2022 Interesting nature trails.\n\n\u2022 BBQ pits available.\n\n\u2022 Sites available to book for larger groups.\n\n\u2022 Washroom facilities on site.\n<h3>Assiniboine Forest<\/h3>\n<em>Situated between Chalfont Avenue to the west and Shaftsbury Boulevard to the east.<\/em>\n\nFinally, la pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance! If you want to feel like you are in a natural park and without leaving the city, Assiniboine Forest is the place for you. This park will appeal to both the explorer and the observer in you. Its trails range in length from 1.1 km to 2.8 km, and lead you through everything from thick forest to wetlands. Make your way to the Eve Werier Memorial Pond to enjoy a beautiful observation area with plenty of seating.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_5842\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-5842\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Assiniboine-Forest-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/> Assiniboine Forest, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Appeal:<\/strong> Trees, trails, wetlands, and prairie grasses make this park a microcosm of Manitoba.\n\n\u2022 Parking lot is located at the corner of Grant Avenue and Chalfont Road.\n\n\u2022 Washroom facilities available at the entrance.\n\n\u2022 Five trails to explore.\n<h3>Packing Your Picnic Basket<\/h3>\nThe beauty of a picnic is that you can make it as simple or as elaborate as you want! One of our favourite picnics entails a weekend visit to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tallgrassbakery.ca\/\">Tall Grass Prairie Bread Company<\/a>, either at The Forks or in Wolseley, where we pick up cinnamon buns. After a quick stop at Starbucks for coffee, we\u2019re off we go to picnic in the park.\n\nSo embrace the rest of the season, get outdoors, and have a picnic",

		"content": "Heated underground parking might seem like a luxury, but in Winnipeg it\u2019s downright life-changing. I hate to even say the dreaded w word yet, but there are many perks to underground heated parking\u2014especially during Winnipeg\u2019s harsh winters! Here are some of the best reasons to look for parking underground.\n<h3>No More Morning Duties<\/h3>\nIf you are like me and value your sleep, a giant perk of heated underground parking is that you save major time in the morning. Instead of waking up twenty minutes earlier to bundle up, trudge outside, and work up a sweat clearing inches of snow and ice off your car, only to then wait another miserable ten minutes for your car to warm up, you can be in bed hitting your snooze button for the third time. With heated underground parking, you don\u2019t have to spend half of your day preparing your car for departure, you just hop in and go!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_5887\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"819\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-5887\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Heated Parking, Parkade, Underground Parkade, Winnipeg Square Parkade, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, snowy road, winter street\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" \/> Photo by Ian Keefe from Unsplash[\/caption]\n\nYou\u2019ll also have somewhere to plug in your car, guaranteeing it will start on those extra toe-numbing days that always come around in January. A warm underground parking spot will also protect your wheels from the elements, so it won\u2019t be 100% dependent on being plugged in.\n<h3>Keeping Your Car Clean<\/h3>\nWinnipeg roads are the epitome of dirty\u2014especially on groggy winter days when it\u2019s almost impossible not to drive into a pothole full of brown slush. Sometimes, you just want to make your car all spiffy but fear the mix of the leftover water and Winnipeg\u2019s frigid days. But if you\u2019re headed back to your cozy, underground heated parking spot afterwards, you can scrub your car without a care in the world. Plus, underground parking ensures you\u2019ll be taking fewer trips to the carwash by avoiding those extra splashes of dirt your car would receive parked on the street.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5890\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/car-3266965_1920-1024x680.jpg\" alt=\"Heated Parking, Parkade, Underground Parkade, Winnipeg Square Parkade, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, snowy road, winter street, slushy winter, muddy car\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" \/>\n<h3>Keeping Your Car Safe<\/h3>\nYour car is less likely to be dinged or damaged by passing cars when it\u2019s parked safely underground. And if you do have the misfortune of receiving a ding from a car door or a smashed bumper, most underground parking lots have security cameras. So if the offending driver didn\u2019t leave a note, you might be able to find out how it happened. Underground parking also helps protects you from those always ill-timed street parking break-ins.\n<h3>No More Parking Tickets<\/h3>\n\u201cBe right back, I need to go move my car!\u201d\n\nSound familiar? Underground parking also saves you from getting a parking ticket (or three). Many underground parking lots have you pick up a ticket when you enter and pay for your time when you leave. So no rushing to move your car each hour, or leaving your dinner date to go plug more quarters into the meter. If you have the option of including parking in your rent, that\u2019s even more convenient!\n\n<center><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FWinnipegMomOnline%2Fposts%2F1878140362231098&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"632\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n<h3>Save Big on Time and Energy<\/h3>\nDowntown Winnipeg is known for having limited parking on their streets, especially during the 9 to 5 on workdays.

The warm embrace of an amber afternoon, the bluntness of the nippy air, the inviting smell of apples and spice\u2026 September marks the halt of weekends at the lake, picnics in the park and sipping icy drinks on a sweltering afternoon.\n\nWinnipeggers don\u2019t immediately think of downtown when they wonder where to spend an autumn day, but it\u2019s my go-to spot!\n<h3>Stroll the Assiniboine River<\/h3>\nFall is perfect for taking beautiful scenic photos and spending time outdoors. There\u2019s nothing more relaxing and rejuvenating than enjoying nature. One of my favourite places in downtown during fall is along the Assiniboine River\u2014I love the crisp air and the carpet of leaves crunching beneath my feet as I stroll the path. It\u2019s always confounded me that the sound of dead leaves can make the air crackle with life.\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BL3-HvVj08o\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\"background:#FFF;border:0;border-radius:3px;margin: 1px;max-width:540px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px);width:calc(100% - 2px)\">\n<div style=\"padding:16px\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BL3-HvVj08o\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;align-items: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 40px;margin-right: 14px;width: 40px\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 100px\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 60px\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px\">\n<div style=\"color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:550;line-height:18px\"> View this post on Instagram<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;margin-bottom: 14px;align-items: center\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px;flex-grow: 0;margin-right: 14px;margin-left: 2px\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 20px;width: 20px\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 2px solid transparent;border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom: 2px solid transparent\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right: 8px solid transparent\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;flex-grow: 0;height: 12px;width: 16px\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left: 8px solid transparent\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center;margin-bottom: 24px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 224px\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 144px\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BL3-HvVj08o\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><\/a>\n<p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BL3-HvVj08o\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Denise Runions (@msdeerun)<\/a> on Oct 22, 2016 at 11:02am PDT<\/p>\n\n<\/div><\/blockquote>\n\n\nMy route usually starts at the Forks, where I grab a steaming cup of joe from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foolsandhorses.ca\/the-forks.html\">Fools and Horses<\/a>. Warming beverage in hand, I make my way west, ending up outside the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.mb.ca\/legislature\/visiting\/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building<\/a>.

Downtown Winnipeg is the hub for the top-of-the-line coffee shops, and the place to be to satisfy your pumpkin-spiced cravings. Coffee shops such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foolsandhorses.ca\/the-forks.html\">Fools and Horses<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thombargen.com\/home-blend\">Thom Bargen<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/secondcup.com\/location\/254-edmonton-street\">Second Cup Coffee Co.<\/a> are some of my top-picks for their seasonal drink menus. Here are some of my favourite seasonal drinks, guaranteed to have you feeling warm and toasty from the inside out.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.foolsandhorses.ca\/the-forks.html\"><strong>Fools and Horses<\/strong><\/a>\nFools and Horses is not afraid to get a little creative with hot fall drinks; they offer pumpkin spice lattes, but their Boreal Latte truly shines! This delicious beverage is created with one-of-a-kind ingredients including pine syrup, sage, sweetgrass, elderflower, and juniper.

Regardless of its size or location, the one thing you know for sure is that it isn\u2019t working for you. You want it to change. You\u2019re just not sure what that means or where to begin.\n\nNo, I\u2019m not about to tell you what to do with it. I am by no means an expert; I have found myself in your predicament more than once. Typically, my fix was calling my sister and brother-in-law for guidance. I\u2019ve called them for help for something as simple as a colour choice. (At least, I thought it was simple!)\n\nI can\u2019t offer up their phone number, but I can tell you that getting an outside opinion is never a bad idea. But who should you call?\n\nI called on Kelly Porath. Kelly is the force behind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blueroseinteriors.com\/\">Blue Rose Interiors<\/a>, a Winnipeg-based interior design firm. You may know Kelly from her segments on CTV Morning Live with Terri Apostle. I presented her with a hypothetical situation.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCTVMorningWPG%2Fposts%2F1692892317414267&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"512\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<h3>The Situation<\/h3>\nYou have a great office space, but more often than not you find yourself working at your kitchen table. You have come to the conclusion that your office is simply not conducive to getting work done. It never gets direct sunlight and its decor doesn\u2019t help. In fact, you think that it makes the room feel even smaller.\n\nYou want that to change. After all, the idea of having a home office is one of the reasons you chose this apartment in the first place!\n\nWith this scenario in mind, Kelly provided a few pointers to solve your office dilemma.\n\n<strong>Paint<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Dark colours absorb light and light ones reflect more light into the space.<\/li>\n \t<li>Never pick your paint colours in the store.<\/li>\n \t<li>Walk around the space, holding your paint sample.<\/li>\n \t<li>Consider painting the entire room a single colour to unify the space, making it feel larger.<\/li>\n \t<li>Use a neutral colour as a backdrop, and then use accent pieces to bring in colour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5928\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n\n<strong>Mirrors<\/strong>\n\nReflective surfaces make a space feel larger. A mirror can make the walls feel as if they have moved out. Having said that, how you position a mirror is very important. Be aware of what the mirror will reflect and don\u2019t install them too high. If hanging a mirror over a sofa, position the mirror so its bottom edge is 6 to 9 inches above the back of the couch. The mirror\u2019s size should be proportional to the size of the room.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5929\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/>\n\n<strong>Lighting<\/strong>\n\nIn general, people will not spend time in a dark room. They\u2019ll instinctively move to a well-lit room instead. No surprise here; you\u2019re living that reality now!\n\nBegin by considering the ambient lighting\u2060\u2014the natural light entering the space, as well as any artificial lighting that may already exist. When decorating an office, consider task lighting. Task lighting is the light needed to perform a certain task, such as reading or working on a desktop.\n\nFinally, make sure to use a combination of table and floor lamps in order to balance the lighting.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5930\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" \/>\n\n<strong>Furniture<\/strong>\n\nThe key to a well-styled room is to make sure that your furniture is proportionate to the size of the room. If you kept your favourite furnishings in your most recent move, ask yourself how well they fit your new home. Remember they were purchased to fit a different space. You may need to purchase new pieces that fit your new space.\n\nAnd finally, avoid \u201csmall item-itis.\u201d Visual clutter makes a space feel smaller. Simplify, simplify, simplify.\n<h3>Thank you, Kelly!<\/h3>\nKelly provided some great tips to get you back into your hypothetical office. Many of her tips can be applied to any decorating situation!\n\nWhile browsing Kelly\u2019s website, I came across this insightful line: \u201cYour environment shapes your thoughts, feelings, and motivations.\u201d That struck a chord with me and has made me appreciate even more the guidance that I have received over the years from my sister and brother-in law. It also really made me appreciate the value that a professional like Kelly brings to the table.\n\nTo learn more about Kelly and the Blue Rose Interiors story, visit blueroseinteriors.com or find Blue Rose Interiors on Facebook.",

		"content": "Does the idea of furniture shopping bring you feelings of glee\u2014or dread? Even if it\u2019s not your favourite thing, choose furniture carefully to ensure you have a happy, comfortable abode. There is no one style that will suit everyone, so let\u2019s look at some things you should consider before you furnish your digs.\n<h3>The Living Room<\/h3>\nWe\u2019ll start in the living room or family room. You\u2019ve got options when it comes to your furniture upholstery, such as leather, wood or fabric. What will work best for you depends on a few factors.\n\nNice furnishings don\u2019t always mix well with children or clawed pets. If you have small children or a feline who loves to scratch, you might want to save yourself some heartache and avoid expensive materials like leather.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5964\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/IMG_4018-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou should also consider the temperature you tend to keep your home at. If you like thing on the warm side, be aware that leather can stick to bare skin. There\u2019s nothing fun about the sting that follows peeling your body off leather furniture. On the other hand, leather is durable and comfy to sink into. For the vegans or vegetarians among you, leather is likely out, so you may want to consider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/ca\/en\/p\/vimle-sofa-with-chaise-farsta-dark-brown-s79206994\/\">artificial leather<\/a> or a different type of upholstery.\n\nWood can be nice for some furnishings, but you don\u2019t want an entire couch made of it. (Imagine trying to take an afternoon nap on that.) Wood can stand up to Fluffy and her talons, though, so you might look for couches and chairs that pair wood frames with fabric coverings if you have a particularly-destructive cat. Wood gives a room a nice look and has great durability. I have cube-shaped, solid-wood end tables that I can stand on. They\u2019re great for when my short frame needs to dust high places. Places like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biglowwoodcraft.com\/\">Biglow Woodcraft<\/a> make beautiful pieces right here in Winnipeg.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5961\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-681x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"681\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n\nCost is another factor when we decide what to buy. Leather and wood tend to be more expensive than fabric, so they might end up out of your price range. When considering cost, think about how long you intend to have that piece of furniture. Some people want to buy something and use it forever, and others like to change up their d\u00e9cor regularly. You may want to spend a bit less if you can\u2019t see yourself liking the same desk or chair for years; you\u2019ll want to replace it eventually.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5966\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n\nThe size of your space also plays a major role in your furniture shopping. You might love the idea of a gigantic sectional so all your friends can come over and watch Jets games, but a sectional won\u2019t work in a tiny apartment. Instead, you might choose something like this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesefourwalls.ca\/sofas-sectionals\/axis-sofa\">plush-looking condo sofa<\/a>. My home is small, so we\u2019ve gotten good at picking up furniture that fits in our space. Some people look at Ikea with disdain, but it\u2019s a great place to find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/ms\/en_JP\/rooms_ideas\/small_spaces\/index.html\">pieces designed for small spaces<\/a>. We wanted a futon for our spare bedroom\/office, but the room doesn\u2019t have space for a double-sized futon. Ikea came to our rescue with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/ca\/en\/p\/vallentuna-sleeper-module-with-backrests-hillared-light-blue-s49277488\/\">chair futon<\/a> that folds out into a single bed. It\u2019s also super comfy!\n\nYou can look for other furniture that does double duty. We store cooking magazines inside an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urbanbarn.com\/en\/product\/fay-storage-ottoman--alexa-steel-212122.html?cgid=LIVING-SEATING-OTTOMANSBENCHES#sz=12&amp;start=21\">ottoman that opens up to double as storage<\/a>. Floating shelves look good and provide storage for books and knick-knacks.\n<h3>The Dining Experience<\/h3>\nDoes your dining room table simply act as a repository for your mail and random objects? Or do you fancy yourself a chef and do a lot of entertaining? If you\u2019re more the chef type, choose your table wisely. Will you have enough room for your friends and family to gather around?\n\nLook for a table that extends if you sometimes need to serve a larger group. Keep in mind that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designmanitoba.com\/store\/p2052\/Nexus_Extendable_table_by_Amisco.html\">extendable tables<\/a> are not all equal. How easy is it to extend\/collapse? Do you have to store the extra leaf somewhere else? We bought a great table from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urbanbarn.com\/en\/home\/\">Urban Barn<\/a> a few years ago. It extends so we can host a crowd, and one person can set up the extension without help. The extra leaf butterflies and folds down under the table, so we don\u2019t have to store it anywhere else in our already-tight space. It\u2019s a far cry from the tables of old that needed (at least) two people and an engineering degree to add or remove a huge leaf, which took up valuable storage space when not in use.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5968\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/IMG_6104-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n\nPay attention to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebrick.com\/collections\/furniture-dining-room-chairs\">dining chairs<\/a>, too. Do people often linger at your table? If so, choose chairs that can be comfortable for a few hours. When we bought our table, we had the option of purchasing coordinating benches that would have seated 3 people each. They were beautiful, solid wood benches\u2014and horribly uncomfortable. We found wood-framed chairs with leather upholstery instead, so our guests don\u2019t need to visit the chiropractor after dining with us.\n\nChairs also allow you to show off your personal style. You can choose chairs all in the same subdued hue or add a bit of flair and a pop of colour! We had 4 different colour options when we bought our dining chairs and couldn\u2019t decide which we liked better. So we bought 2 of each colour! Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apartmenttherapy.com\/mismatched-dining-chairs-262815\">mismatched chairs<\/a> add a bit of whimsy to our slate grey table.\n\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 500px; border: #eee 1px solid;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.apartmenttherapy.com\/mismatched-dining-chairs-262815\"><\/iframe>\n<h3>Technology Can Help You Decide<\/h3>\nWhen looking for furniture, you can download a room design app to help you decide what you want! It\u2019s fun to virtually plan out a room to see what it might look like and what will fit. With the right app, you can do more than use your imagination when you are trying to decide what works and doesn\u2019t. Here\u2019s an article that links to some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apartmenttherapy.com\/the-7-best-apps-for-room-design-amp-room-layout-244213\">popular room design apps you can try<\/a>.\n\nI\u2019d still recommend going to showrooms, since look and size are only part of the picture when it comes to choosing furniture. I\u2019m always most concerned with comfort and practicality in my furniture, but you can choose to go entirely online for your furniture buying. Either way, take the time to do your research and think about what you truly need. Buying furniture is far more expensive than buying clothes and you\u2019ll be living with your decisions for a long time. Don\u2019t get stuck with buyer\u2019s remorse when it comes to your furniture!\n\n<em><strong>Where is your favourite place to shop for furniture in Winnipeg?

There\u2019s never been a better time to take advantage of the overflowing thrift stores to deck out your own space. Shopping secondhand is a win for your planet, your community, and your wallet. Now that sparks joy!\n<h3>Why Thrift?<\/h3>\n<em><strong>Environmental impact<\/strong><\/em>\n\nEvery thrifted item means one less new one produced, which is important because the production of each household item is costly to the environment. By choosing to thrift your household items, you\u2019re helping divert used goods from landfills. Value Village alone diverts over 700 million pounds from landfills annually!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_5988\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"580\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/bozemanmagazine.com\/articles\/2016\/04\/01\/26026_upholstery_in_the_maker_space\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5988\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/From-Bozeman-Magazine.jpg\" alt=\"thrift store, thrifting, shopping for furniture, furniture shopping for your apartment, apartment living winnipeg, 300 Main downtown winnipeg apartments, furniture waste, furniture in landfills\" width=\"580\" height=\"386\" \/><\/a> Photo from an article titled Upholstery in the Maker Space, Bozeman Magazine[\/caption]\n\n<em><strong>Social impact<\/strong><\/em>\n\nThrift stores make it easier to know where your money is going. For instance, one of Winnipeg\u2019s most popular thrift stores, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuevillage.com\/\">Value Village<\/a>, donates a large portion of their proceeds back into the community.\n\n<em><strong>Personal impact<\/strong><\/em>\n\nMy favorite item in my downtown apartment is a unique, red oak coffee table that I copped from <a href=\"http:\/\/canadiangoodwill.ca\/\">Goodwill<\/a> for just $12! Amazed by my deal, I looked online\u2014similar items sold for $150. Need I say more?\n<h3>How to Shop Secondhand D\u00e9cor<\/h3>\nFriendly reminder that when you buy used, you\u2019re technically sharing with the previous owners. Check fabric and upholstered pieces carefully before making your purchase. Always check for M.O.P.S: mildew, odors, pests and stains!\n\n<em><strong>Shop prepared<\/strong><\/em>\n\nKnowing the measurements of the room you want to decorate is key! There\u2019s nothing worse than coming home with your dream rug only to realize it\u2019s way too big for your space. Measure the room beforehand, write the measurements down, and bring a measuring tape with you when you go shopping. These simple precautions will save you so much hassle.\n\nFocus on key pieces first, rather than browsing everything. It\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed when thrifting. You might be on a mission for a coffee table but end up lost among dozens of decorative mirrors.\n\n<em><strong>Look for potential, not perfection<\/strong><\/em>\n\nThrifted goods likely won\u2019t look perfect when you purchase them, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t right for your space.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5990\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"thrift store, thrifting, shopping for furniture, furniture shopping for your apartment, apartment living winnipeg, 300 Main downtown winnipeg apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" \/>\n\n<em><strong>Know your style<\/strong><\/em>\n\nCombining a variety of decorating styles can be a cool, edgy look, but only when done carefully. Avoid decorating seasickness by carefully considering two questions: What\u2019s your existing style, and what colour scheme are you going for?\n\nYou\u2019re decorating a space that you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time in. Make sure you like the items you bring into your space and that they reflect your personal style. You\u2019re doing no one any good by decorating the space in fads and trends that you really don\u2019t truly like. And having an assortment of colours and furniture can be a pretty, eccentric look, but there should always be an overall colour scheme to keep your room cohesive.\n<h3>What to Buy New<\/h3>\n<em><strong>Mattress<\/strong><\/em>\n\nWhen it comes to mattress shopping, I have two words for you: bed bugs! A mattress is one of the most important things to buy after signing the lease to your new apartment. I think it goes without saying that buying a used mattress is a no-no. Bed bugs are great hitchhikers!\n\n<em><strong>Crib<\/strong><\/em>\n\nHaving a baby is expensive, but a crib is not something you should want to skimp on. Buying a used crib is risky, because you don\u2019t know what type of internal damage there might be.\n\n<em><strong>Pet furniture<\/strong><\/em>\n\nYou have no way of knowing what previous pets were up to on second-hand pet beds, crates, blankets or toys. To ensure your furry friend has a clean and safe place to sit or sleep, avoid buying pet items second-hand.\n\n<strong>Do you prefer thrifting or buying new for your apartment?

I had spent months creating Pinterest boards and circling items in Ikea catalogs. As soon as I stepped into my new room, my bubbling excitement quickly fizzled into disgust: lime green walls assaulted my eyes.\n\nI could feel my beautiful aesthetic daydreams being crushed. Unfortunately, my dormitory wouldn\u2019t let me paint the walls, which is standard in a rental. However, I was determined not to let that hideous colour stop me from having the best dorm room in the hall. Here are my cheap and easy tips to save your style when you\u2019re stuck with unpleasant paint!\n<h3>Tapestry is Your New Best Friend<\/h3>\nAs soon as you add a <a href=\"https:\/\/society6.com\/tapestries\/winnipeg\">tapestry<\/a> (or your DIYed fabric) onto your wall, what lies underneath is your little secret. This is the easiest way to make an unfortunate wall colour disappear. Plus, you won\u2019t lose your security deposit when it\u2019s time to move.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_6019\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/society6.com\/product\/winnipeg-skyline-yyh_tapestry?sku=s6-8105496p42a55v412\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6019\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art, winnipeg skyline, tapestry\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" \/><\/a> Winnipeg Skyline Wall Tapestry by MarianVoicu on Etsy[\/caption]\n<h3>Peel-and-Stick Backsplash Tiles or Wallpaper<\/h3>\nYou can pick these up at the dollar store, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homedepot.ca\/en\/home\/categories\/decor\/wallpaper-and-supplies\/wallpaper.html?q=*:relevance:categoryPathHierarchy:3%252Fhd-classes%252Fl1-decor%252Fl2-wallpaper%252Fl3-wallpaper:attributeidWallpApplication2016:Self-Adhesive%252FPeel%2Band%2BStick\">Home Depot<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wallpops.com\/nu1650-birch-tree-peel-and-stick-wallpaper\">online<\/a>, and they\u2019re super easy to apply! You apply them right on top of the paint. When you\u2019re ready to move or just need a change in backdrop, they peel right off.\n<h3>Cover Every Inch in Art<\/h3>\nI\u2019m a self-professed clutter bug and love having lots of action on my walls. If that sounds like you, this is the perfect solution to your wall-based conflict! Divide your wall into sections and decorate it with collages of artwork, mirrors and larger d\u00e9cor\/paintings. Perhaps your style leans more towards weavings, like this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ca\/listing\/677226640\/50-shades?ref=shop_home_active_1&amp;frs=1\">cool piece from Winnipeg artist Rebecca Riel<\/a>.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_6012\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"768\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-6012\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/> ? by Lena Malevitis from Unsplash[\/caption]\n<h3>Use Complementary Colours<\/h3>\nThis ties in with covering the wall in art. It might seem difficult to compliment a colour you hate, but this tip can really add to your d\u00e9cor. For example, to deal with my lime green walls I added muted and neutral tones. I used black and white photographs, a darker green tapestry and a mocha-coloured mirror. Even though I was working with the colour of the wall, it worked with my style and drew more attention to it.\n\nFor help finding colour inspiration, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecturelab.net\/\">www.architecturelab.net<\/a> is a great resource.\n<h3>Reflect with a Mirror<\/h3>\nA sculptural <a href=\"https:\/\/www.picturesframesandmore.com\/mirrors\/page-id-166\/Decorative\/\">mirror<\/a> is a great, eye-pleasing way to direct attention away from the wall. For starters, mirrors are wonderful for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apartmenttherapy.com\/10-ways-to-use-mirrors-to-make-113181\">making rooms appear bigger<\/a> and illuminating your space. They\u2019re also great for directing attention! Your guests will be more prone to looking at themselves in the mirror than to notice what it\u2019s hiding.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_6014\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-6014\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-1024x749.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art\" width=\"1024\" height=\"749\" \/> ? by Erin Profaci from Pexels[\/caption]\n<h3>Make Another Wall the Focus<\/h3>\nI found myself putting a lot of effort into the wall adjacent to the lime green fiasco. That way, when guests came into my room their attention was immediately drawn to the cool photos on the other wall. I also hung lights around the space.\n<h3>Add Greenery<\/h3>\nAdding a couple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verdeywg.shop\/product\/ctenanthe-lubbersiana\/449?cp=true&amp;sa=false&amp;sbp=false&amp;q=false&amp;category_id=2\">tall potted plants<\/a> beside a wall is one of the easiest ways to direct attention away from the wall behind. Plants might even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/nomanazish\/2018\/02\/10\/think-you-dont-need-houseplants-science-says-different\/#25af3ef53595\">help you relax<\/a>!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6016\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/photo-of-swiss-cheese-plant-3125195-874x1024.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, potted plant\" width=\"874\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n<h3>Consider a Cabinet<\/h3>\nIf you\u2019ve been thinking about investing in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pier1.ca\/cremone-rubbed-black-72%22-tall-cabinet\/4121735.html?cgid=bookshelves-decorative-cabinets#nav=left&amp;origin=gridswatch\">hefty cabinetry<\/a> or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.structube.com\/en\/madras-bookcase-47-02-94?pid=18071\">bigger bookshelf<\/a>, this is the time to bite the bullet and make a purchase.\n\nHaving a not-so-great paint job is not the end of the world. Instead of looking at it as a hassle, try looking at it as motivation to be experimental and creative!\n\n<em><strong>Have any tips on how to decorate a wall colour that we did not cover?

		"content": "Every time I hear the word \u201ctimeless\u201d in relation to fashion or home d\u00e9cor, I feel so much hope. This piece of furniture or pair of shoes will last, will indeed be timeless.\n\nIn my living room stands a small, mustard-yellow, mid-century sofa. Was this style of sofa fashionable in the 1950s? Absolutely. Is it fashionable today? Certainly. Will it be fashionable in twenty years? I dare say so. Having those three definite answers in mind helped me decide to buy that piece of furniture. Asking if it was timeless helped even more when my subconscious decided I would enjoy this sofa for the next twenty years.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6036\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n\nSome things might be considered fundamentals of timeless fashion, but what\u2019s timeless for each of us might be different. What we decide to call <em>lasting<\/em> and <em>classic<\/em> depends on our ideas of current and vintage trends. It comes from our backgrounds, preferences, and our feelings.\n\nI might call my yellow sofa timeless, but it might not be something you want to see in your living room every day for the next twenty years. I know why the tweed Chanel suit is considered beautiful and timeless, but it\u2019s just not for me. When it comes to home d\u00e9cor, the same rules apply; each piece of furniture should suit your vision and your lifestyle.\n\nThe point of such a talky introduction was only to get us thinking about and appreciating the things we own. In a fast-paced world full of issues such as climate change, plastic and fast-fashion production, we ought to pay attention to the quality and durability of our clothes and furniture. Building a wardrobe and home centered on timeless pieces will make a positive difference to both your life and the environment. Let\u2019s look at the process of searching for d\u00e9cor that will last.\n<h3>1. Stay away from clich\u00e9s<\/h3>\nA home that evokes sighs of admiration with its timeless style wasn't decorated in a week. Everything that deserves attention, anything that will last, takes time, love and effort to find. I\u2019m not trying to judge Costco or IKEA. However, I tend to believe in other, more sophisticated and exciting ways of discovering your home essentials.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6038\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, ikea\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/>\n\nCurrent trends, which tell us to live more organically and embrace slow-fashion and slow-living, affect our ideas about the right way to shop. There are many ways to avoid mass-produced pieces of furniture to find something that will add character to your place that you\u2019ll treasure and enjoy using.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Visit flea markets and antique stores, like <a href=\"http:\/\/antiquesandfunk.com\/\">Antiques &amp; Funk<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/thejohnstonterminal.com\/\">Johnston Terminal Antique Mall<\/a>. Honestly, what compares to the thrill of finding a chair in Louis XIV style, or a set of old chandeliers to make each dinner and party you host sparkle?<a href=\"https:\/\/thejohnstonterminal.com\/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6040 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Johnston-Terminal-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, johnston terminal\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n \t<li>Try local furniture boutiques. When people hear the word \u201cboutique,\u201d they tend to imagine high-end pieces with high-end prices. But you\u2019d be surprised by the quality you can find at affordable prices My yellow couch, for example, cost just under $600, and the quality and the style are tremendous!<\/li>\n \t<li>Frequent local marketplaces that feature artists and makers. These markets, like <a href=\"https:\/\/alleywaysmarket.ca\/\">Alleyways Market<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/thirdandbirdevents.com\/\">Third + Bird<\/a>, can be found throughout the year in Winnipeg. Many artists will have examples at their booths that can be pre-ordered or purchased on the spot. I\u2019ve found beautiful wooden side tables, kitchen items made from olive wood, and handmade woven baskets that are great for d\u00e9cor and storage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/thirdandbirdevents.com\/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg\" alt=\"third + bird\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Go treasure hunting at thrift stores and second-hand places. Sure, sometimes you\u2019ll leave empty-handed, but you might also leave with pieces that will suit your style and serve you loyally. Search thrift stores for small details like a magazine stand, books, candelabras or even seasonal decorations. You\u2019ll find unique pieces while doing your part for the environment by reusing, recycling, and restyling.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Add culture to your place<\/h3>\nMy great-grandmother was <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ruska_Roma\">Ruska Roma<\/a>. Learning this explained a lot about my preferences. Every time I promised myself that I would keep my house minimalistic, and style it simply with bohemian pieces, I would find something a colourful carpet, golden candle holder, or velvet pillow I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nDon\u2019t let a fear of being different blind you. Don\u2019t force yourself to follow trends and clich\u00e9s if you feel no connection to it. I\u2019m not saying to surround yourself with only appropriate cultural pieces. You don\u2019t want your home to be a museum; you want it to be your home that reflects who you are and feels comfortable and warm. Add culture by mixing in art pieces (maybe something you picked up while travelling) with modern furniture for a timeless look.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6045\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, bohemian\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n\nImagine a room where the main pieces, like the sofa, chairs, and table, are simple, but the room feels full of character. Look closer, and you will notice more than basic furniture. Is that a rug from India? Are there French impressionist paintings? Photographs? Are there handmade vases from Poland? Discover what your culture is about and sprinkle it throughout your home.\n<h3>3. Let the basics be timeless<\/h3>\nI\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again: everyone has their own interpretation of what makes something timeless. However, there are some standard rules for choosing timeless pieces.\n\nAllow bigger pieces such as sofas, dining tables, kitchen cabinets, and your bed to be timeless. The same rules that apply in fashion apply to interior design: keep your essential wardrobe and basic furniture functional and timeless. Then, add trendy or cultural notes to it seasonally.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6046\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" \/>\n\nTimeless furniture makes a functional base but doesn't have to be boring. Research the epoch you find the most delightful or interesting and be inspired by its designs. Pay attention to descriptions such as \u201cretro\u201d, \u201cmid-century\u201d and \u201ccontemporary\u201d; you might even keep an eye out for \u201cVictorian\u201d if you like a bit of pomp. Use these pieces fearlessly as your basics.\n\nIf cultural or trendy decorative details suit your personality, then timeless furniture is your neutral base. The more timeless and essential your main furniture is, the longer it will stay with you. You merely won't get tired of its appearance and presence.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe advice that helped me: start a mood board (physical or just on Pinterest) and do your research. Collect ideas for timeless (but not dull and boring!) interior design pieces. Then, enjoy the slow thrill of the furniture hunt at antique stores, little unknown shops. Search Instagram for artists and handcrafters; you might find unique dish sets, side tables, pillows and baskets. When you\u2019re finished, your home will be more than just a shelter. It will be full of useful, uncommon pieces that have a story behind them; pieces that serve you and express your individuality. And that\u2019s truly timeless.\n\n<em><strong>What are your favourite places for finding unique, lasting pieces of furniture? Leave your tips in the comments!<\/strong><\/em>",

		"content": "Canadians are increasingly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macleans.ca\/news\/canada\/census-2016-a-picture-of-a-bigger-more-urban-canada\/\">living in cities<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/canadapopulation.org\/winnipeg-population\/\">Winnipeg is no exception<\/a>. It can sometimes be hard for communities with fast-growing populations to keep up with the infrastructure needs for new residents. That\u2019s why many cities are gravitating towards more high-density housing as part of their \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartcitiesdive.com\/ex\/sustainablecitiescollective\/urban-density-and-sustainability\/241696\/\">smart growth<\/a>\u201d strategies.\n<h3>What is High-Density Housing?<\/h3>\nHigh-density housing simply is housing that packs more people per geographic unit. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/300main.ca\/\">300 Main<\/a> is a 40-storey apartment building that will be home to several hundred city dwellers. Communities that are urbanizing sometimes encourage developers to add higher-density complexes to their downtown areas. There are many advantages to these tall multiplexes.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_6065\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/300main.ca\/\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-6065\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Final_C2-1024x775.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"775\" \/><\/a> 3D Rendering of 300 Main[\/caption]\n\nHigher-density neighbourhoods have a strong sense of community and connectedness because people are just in closer contact with each other. High-density housing usually entails high-rise buildings such as 300 Main. Higher population density is essential for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.ca\/ypnexthome\/high-density-housing-gta_b_17208346.html\">developing busy, vivacious neighbourhoods<\/a> with lots of features. It allows for beautiful public spaces like downtown Winnipeg to make life convenient, enjoyable and, most importantly, green!\n<h3>Sustainable Design<\/h3>\nAs cities <a href=\"https:\/\/canada.constructconnect.com\/dcn\/news\/economic\/2019\/04\/canadas-major-cities-ride-slipstream-surging-population-growth\">boom in population<\/a> and invest to meet the needs of their new citizens, sustainability has also become a major focus. High-rise apartments are one of the easiest ways to make a community more sustainable. They have a smaller footprint than that of many smaller buildings.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_6069\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"680\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-6069\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg, Chicago, High Rise Buildings in Chicago, High Rise Apartments in Chicago\" width=\"680\" height=\"1024\" \/> Chicago, United States by Cameron Casey from Pexels[\/caption]\n\nIf neighbourhoods want to continue to grow, all they need to do is look up! Building up, or even on top of, is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citylab.com\/equity\/2012\/01\/why-most-environmental-building-building-weve-already-built\/1016\/\">more environmentally-friendly<\/a> than conventional demolished-site redevelopment.\n<h3>Size Matters (For Energy)<\/h3>\nDenser neighbourhoods that include apartment blocks or condos also use less energy. Residences that are stacked or bunched should <a href=\"https:\/\/ottawacitizen.com\/life\/homes\/modern-housing-why-highrises-are-good-for-the-environment\">use less energy<\/a>. For example, an apartment suite in 300 Main is more efficient to heat and cool than a detached suburban house. So even on cold winter nights (which us Winnipeggers know sometimes start in October), if every apartment suite were to turn their heat up, they\u2019d be using less energy than the equivalent number of houses. Higher-density neighbourhoods also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/trying-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-dont-fall-for-these-myths\/\">create fewer harmful emissions<\/a>. As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citylab.com\/life\/2012\/04\/why-bigger-cities-are-greener\/863\/\">Richard Florida at CityLab<\/a> says, \u201cWhen it comes to greenness, <a href=\"http:\/\/martinprosperity.org\/insights\/insight\/cities-and-co2-bigger-is-better\">size matters<\/a>.\u201d\n<h3>Encourages more Walking, Cycling and Use of Public Transportation<\/h3>\nThough downtown areas can seem busy, there are major benefits to living and working downtown. Dense downtown neighbourhoods help residents drive less and walk more, without giving up their lifestyles. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/40492045\/living-in-a-dense-city-makes-citizens-healthier\">Research<\/a> has shown that lower density promotes sedentary behavior. If your home is far away from the grocery store and your office, you\u2019re going to spend more time in a car and less time being active.\n\nhttps:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible\/\n\nHigh-density housing encourages walking and cycling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/trying-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-dont-fall-for-these-myths\/\">because everything is closer<\/a> together! Transit is also promoted by high-density housing, as transit connections become more common when neighborhood density increases. Many city dwellers find it more convenient to jump on a transit bus and be at work in a stress-free jiffy, rather than drive to work, deal with traffic, and find parking. Talk about a headache!\n\nIndividuals who live in suburban areas can also benefit from people taking transit to work. Fewer cars on the road equal fewer harmful emissions, like carbon dioxide.\n<h3>What\u2019s Big, Green, and Sustainable?<\/h3>\nHigh-density housing is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/georgemonbiot\/2011\/jun\/30\/sustainable-cities-urban-planning\">sustainable choice<\/a> for growing cities. Tall buildings are more than just towers of concrete and steel; they\u2019re a fundamental part of successful urbanization. They offer a greener, less wasteful, and more energy-efficient way of life.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_6072\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"954\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-6072\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-954x1024.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg, New York, New York Apartment Buildings\" width=\"954\" height=\"1024\" \/> New York, United States by Craig Adderley from Pexels[\/caption]",

It can sometimes be hard for communities with fast-growing populations to keep up with the infrastructure needs for new residents. That\u2019s why many cities are gravitating towards more high-density housing as part of their \u201csmart growth\u201d strategies.",

		"content": "Holiday decorating is one of the best parts of winter, and living in a tiny apartment shouldn\u2019t mean you have to miss out! Decorating for the holidays in a small space can be tricky, so we\u2019re here to help with a collection of festive ideas.\n\n<strong>Christmas Tree Chaos<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Miniature Tree<\/strong>\nIt may be small, but a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/s?bbn=6647219011&amp;rh=n%3A2206275011%2Cn%3A%212206276011%2Cn%3A2224027011%2Cn%3A2224031011%2Cn%3A13848649011%2Cn%3A6647219011%2Cp_n_size_browse-bin%3A6819137011&amp;dc&amp;fst=as%3Aoff&amp;qid=1574642410&amp;rnid=6819135011&amp;ref=lp_6647219011_nr_p_n_size_browse-bin_1\">miniature Christmas tree<\/a> can still pack a stylish punch. A tiny tree is one of the easiest and most common decorations for small spaces. I decorate my miniature tree with an over-the-top tree topper, festive ornaments, and twinkling fairy lights. I also like to sweeten it up with a few candy canes. Even though it\u2019s tiny, I love how my Christmas tree lights up the room with its larger-than-life presence.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6093\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n\n<strong>Half of a Christmas Tree\n<\/strong>I admit this one requires an open mind. When I first heard about half Christmas trees, I thought whoever came up with the idea was insane. But, after a few sleepless nights up thinking about it (it <em>really<\/em> bothered me), I realized its brilliance!\n\nTuck this slim, festive fellow in a corner for all the fun of a full-size Christmas tree for half the space. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/TANGKULA-Artificial-Christmas-Half-Shape-Decoration\/dp\/B081MYBNG7\/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=half+christmas+tree&amp;qid=1574640178&amp;sr=8-16\">Amazon<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walmart.ca\/en\/ip\/Home-Heritage-7-Ft-Pre-Lit-Artificial-Half-Christmas-Tree-with-Folding-Stand\/PRD1TCPD0VT30L5\">Walmart<\/a> sell cheap but high-quality half Christmas trees.\n\n<strong>A Christmas Tree Doesn\u2019t Need to be Pine\n<\/strong>When you imagine a Christmas tree, you\u2019re automatically going to picture a lush, green pine tree. But I\u2019m here to advocate for all the other types of plant that can be just as festive!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6090\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-671x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"671\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more greenery or just don\u2019t want to go out and buy a tree, consider giving one of your houseplants a chance to shine this holiday season. I like to decorate the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shelmerdine.com\/product\/fiddle-leaf-fig-tree\/\">fiddle leaf fig tree<\/a> in my bedroom with bulbs, holly and candy canes. It\u2019s quirky and brings so much character to the room.\n\n<strong>Festive Fairy Light Tree\n<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/Kohree-Changing-Decorative-Stroller-DecorTree\/dp\/B01HO0RVCI\/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=fairy+lights&amp;qid=1574642608&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-7\">Fairy lights<\/a> have so many uses; you can string them up or get creative! When I was first settling into my downtown apartment and wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to invest in a tree, I created one myself. Pair your fairy lights with garland and pin them up on your wall in the shape of a pine tree (or a fiddle leaf fig tree!), and you\u2019ve got yourself a DIY Christmas tree. Be creative: you can attach bulbs or even candy canes to it, just like a real tree.\n\nThis trick can also be used as a decoration hack for those who celebrate other holidays. Creating a Star of David with the lights on your wall is just as simple and beautiful!\n<h3>Mantel Makeover<\/h3>\nI\u2019m pretty lucky; my apartment has a brick fireplace with a beautiful oak mantel. If you have a fireplace, decorating the mantel is an easy way to display small decorations without taking up floor space.\n\nSince I like to keep the rest of my living room fairly simple for Holiday decorating, I make the mantle my centerpiece. I prefer traditional Christmas colours, so I decorate my mantel with deep greens by pinning a flocked pine wreath above the fireplace and draping garland across the mantle. I then strategically place crimson-red holly within the garland and finish the look by pinning up a few red stockings. The stockings also draw my guests\u2019 eyes down to the burning fire underneath, completing the cozy look I\u2019m going for.\n\n<strong>Utilizing Holiday Cards<\/strong>\nI don\u2019t know about you, but as soon as December 1st hits I\u2019m bombarded with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ca\/search?q=christmas+card&amp;locationQuery=6183235\">holiday cards<\/a> from family, friends and co-workers. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love them, but at first I was confused about what to do with all of them. Eventually, inspiration struck and I started selecting a few with the most festive illustrations to display on my mantel behind my garland. Not only do they make cheerful decorations, they also remind me of my loved ones.\n<h3>Deck the Halls\u2014Literally!<\/h3>\n<strong>Mistletoe\n<\/strong>Mistletoe is a winter classic that doesn\u2019t take up any space at all. All you need is a doorway, such as in a hallway, to let the festive smooches begin!\n\n<strong>Paper Snowflakes<\/strong>\nI love decorating my space with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instructables.com\/id\/How-to-Make-6-Pointed-Paper-Snowflakes\/\">paper snowflakes<\/a>. They make me feel so nostalgic about being a kid and spending all winter snipping them out with safety scissors. As an adult, they\u2019re an inexpensive decoration that brings the romance of snow into your home \u2013 without the chill.\n\nI personally like stringing paper snowflakes up on the ceiling, letting them drape down to bring a touch of magic to an entranceway. Try hanging them by a window where they can catch the every-changing winter light.\n<h3>Create a Holiday Scent<\/h3>\nSo, your place looks festive\u2026but does it smell festive? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.charlestonandharlow.com\/collections\/fall-holiday\">Scented candles<\/a> are the easiest way to bring a merry aroma to your apartment. Cinnamon, gingerbread, fire and pine are a few of my favourite scented candle fragrances; all these are super easy to find in your favourite candle shop! Coal and Canary even sells a cute <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coalandcanary.com\/product-page\/holiday-collection-box-set\">Holiday Collection Box Set<\/a>.\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B5RGZdpBM9-\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

There are also the\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.homedepot.ca\/product\/levolor-decorative-roller-shades\/1000113182\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">pull-down roller types<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0or roman blinds if you want to use\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">that fabric you have your eye on, but you might need to get them custom made.<\/span>\n<h3>2. How much work are you willing to put into installing them?<\/h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Blinds contain mechanisms for opening and closing, making them immediately more com<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">plicated. Keep in mind that you\u2019re either going to be mounting them to the inside of the window frame or the wall itself! This means\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">you\u2019ll\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">need to drill directly into something, and be precise with your measurements\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">for\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">inset blinds.<\/span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you\u2019re co<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ncerned about damaging the walls,\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">heavy-duty\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.walmart.ca\/en\/command\/N-1020336\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Command hooks<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0are usually capable of supporting a\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">curtain rod\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">(as long as you\u2019re not hanging those weighty antique velvet drapes). Plus, you\u2019re\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">dealing with just the one rod, so it\u2019s not as complex.<\/span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Here\u2019s a<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">neat trick I came across<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">: W<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">hen you\u2019re marking the spots for the support mounts, if you position an L-shaped piece of cardboard against the window frame and push a pencil through, you can flip it around to mark the opposite mounting point evenly. (So simpl<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">e, yet so genius.\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Thanks, Youtube!)<\/span>\n<h3>3. How frequently are you going to clean them?<\/h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Now this one, you need to\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">be<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0honest about.\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Nobody stays on top of their cleaning as much as they\u2019d like to.

As the\u00a0introvertiest\u00a0of introverts, spending time at home is something I relish, but if you\u2019re the type who likes to be on the go, you probably feel like you\u2019re grounded and it\u00a0<\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">wasn\u2019t even your fault<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">! Lucky for you, being sent to my room was always my punishment of choice.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you\u2019re stuck at home, here is my guide on how to cope in confinement:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<h3>Step 1: Take a deep breath<\/h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">The first thing to remember is that you\u2019re at home,\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">so\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">relax! Easier said than done, I know. When you have places to go and people to see, you\u2019re usually on a clearly<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">-<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">defined schedule. Since you\u2019re\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">staying\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">home\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">right\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">now, take a deep breath and slow down: sleep in longer than usual, stay up late watching that critically<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">-<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">acclaimed movie, prepare that delicious but oh-so-time-consuming recipe. Whatever it is, take your time.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Which brings me to Step 2.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<h3>Step 2: Appreciate the little things<\/h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Reacquaint yourself with how your\u00a0favourite\u00a0chair is comfortable in just the right way and luxuriate in the smell of your coffee. Sometimes when we\u2019re surrounded by the same things every day, we\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">can\u2019t help but\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">take them for granted<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the relaxing we talked about, so I recommend you\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">still\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">get out of bed before a certain time in the morning, change your clothes (you can still wear\u00a0pyjamas, just different\u00a0pyjamas!), and aim to eat your meals and wind down for the night around the same time each day.<\/span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6295\" src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"How to Cope in Confinement During Social Distancing, covid-19. self isolation, self quarantine, social distancing, staying home, coronavirus, working from home, non-essential worker\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" \/>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Now for the hard one:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<h3>Step 4: Set goals<\/h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">I often make lists of the things I\u2019m looking to accomplish over the next\u00a0<\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">X<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0amount of time.\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">My goals can<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0be anything from\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201c<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">do the laundry<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201d<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0to\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201c<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">conquer the world<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201d<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0(though unless you plan on conquering the world from your living room, maybe save that one for later.)\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Keeping a to-do list sounds tedious, but think of\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">it as a\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">really responsible advent calendar<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u2026where\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">you don\u2019t get any chocolate and the days don\u2019t matter<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

I was optimistic, and even enthusiastic, about the idea of isolation in my house with my coffee machine, piles of books and comfortable sofas. You can believe that\u2019s exactly how I spent the first week of the quarantine! Then the second week came, and with it the realization that to stay sane, cheerful and productive, I needed to occupy myself with more than reading and drinking coffee. I started planning each of my days to focus on healthy tasks that would fill my mind with new information, keep my hands busy, and hopefully help me lose the extra pounds that came along with the ice cream and indulgences of the first week.

As soon as the quarantine started, I no longer had that excuse. After spending the first week of quarantine feeling completely overwhelmed and eating too many unhealthy snacks, I browsed YouTube for exercise videos to help me feel healthy and energetic. That\u2019s when I discovered online barre workouts. Since starting barre, I really enjoy spending time early each morning doing barre\u2019s combination of cardio, stretching, and ballet movements.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I\u2019ve also always wanted to learn about literature and art, but never felt like I had the time due to work, family, and life in general. Fortunately, in the age of the internet, access to free quality courses from major universities\u2014including Harvard!\u2014is unlimited, and that is where I found myself. As soon as I discovered a few classes open to the public, I was showing up for online lectures every day to study Goethe, the Odyssey, world literature, Impressionism, and Renaissance paintings.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":6431,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6431\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Perhaps learning about some of the most significant art ever created inspired me to return to painting. When the pressure of devastating news about the virus expanded, and anxiety touched us all, I pulled my brushes and canvas out of the basement. They say to paint flowers when you\u2019re anxious, and that\u2019s what I did. The stress lessened. Painting fruits and flowers brought me back to studying in art school as a child. Those happy times somehow returned with every brush stroke. The first day I pulled out my painting essentials, I drew for hours. It calmed me, giving me hope and inspiring me to create more, whether it was more pictures or writing pieces. While I was occupied with studying, exercising, painting, four weeks of quarantine passed by.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Time moved as quickly as before the quarantine, but I didn\u2019t waste time complaining. Instead, I got back to the joy that exercising daily, studying literature, and painting bring me, and these activities had a huge impact on my mental and physical health. It\u2019s common sense that your body needs physical activity, and your mind needs learning. But caught between chores and obligations in a busy world, we often forget the impact these basic practices can have. I know I forget quite often!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the quarantine was devasting in many ways, I was able to find a routine of pleasures that restored me. In taking as much time as I wished for exercising, writing, and studying, I found reconciliation with part of myself I had forgotten exists. It was as if with the world falling apart, my little nest of delightful activities was building up. But don\u2019t get me wrong: I can\u2019t wait for the end of this global pandemic and the pain it has brought for so many. I can\u2019t wait for the simple ability to travel or spend an hour in a coffee shop\u2014little things that we used to take for granted. But there was something marvellous in living like a lady from a novel, who spends her days in a garden reading or at her easel painting flowers.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":6433,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6433\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->",

A quick win at the beginning of your week starts you off on the right foot and makes the rest of the week seem easier!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6625,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/3Build-your-basics-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Basic ingredients\" class=\"wp-image-6625\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2 - <strong>Consider what\u2019s in your refrigerator.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If those bell peppers are on their last legs or your milk is about to expire, pick recipes that will use them up!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Try writing a master ingredient list for everything you want to make in the coming week. Before you go to the store, go through your fridge, freezer, cupboards, secret food stash in the ceiling and mark off all the things you already have - Ta-da! Whatever is left is your grocery list!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3 - <strong>Build your basics.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A well-stocked pantry is the key to successful home cooking. These are your building blocks for many recipes and are enough on their own to throw together a Plan B meal in a pinch. At minimum, I\u2019m talking about:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Salt &amp; pepper&nbsp;<\/li><li>Olive oil&nbsp;<\/li><li>Soup stock (chicken or veggie are the most versatile),&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Rice&nbsp;<\/li><li>Pasta&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Your&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;vinegar&nbsp; (mine is balsamic but if you\u2019re only going to pick one, white wine vinegar is my recommendation&nbsp; - it\u2019s mild, gives the acidity you want and gives a little wine-y&nbsp;flavor&nbsp;to your recipes).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>And don\u2019t forget a sweetener - honey, agave or even maple syrup!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other good things to keep around are: garlic, ginger, onions, beans (canned for spontaneous beans or dried if you\u2019re really planning ahead), canned tomatoes and some canned soups. There are so many things you can do with a can of mushroom soup! I\u2019ll share my recipe for mushroom \u201cAlfredo\u201d sauce below.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you get an idea of what your go-to recipes take, you\u2019ll know what else you want to keep on hand. You probably want a selection of your&nbsp;cherished&nbsp;condiments and sauces - ever since I discovered <em>Hoisin<\/em> sauce, there is never not some in my fridge!&nbsp;And it never hurts to keep an emergency box of KD around,&nbsp;<em>just&nbsp;<\/em>in case!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6626,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/4Anticipate-leftovers-1024x820.jpg\" alt=\"Food portioned to be frozen\" class=\"wp-image-6626\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>4 - <strong>Anticipate leftovers.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love leftovers! Not only do I get more of the delicious things I already made, but I also get to skip cooking something else. If I make up a big batch of meatballs, that\u2019s three or four meals worth of protein that I can either eat with leftover rice, throw in with other ingredients, or if I don\u2019t want to eat the same thing all week, freeze for later.&nbsp; Which reminds me of...&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>5 - <strong>Batch cook meals to freeze (so when you don\u2019t want to cook, you don\u2019t have to!).&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While you\u2019re cooking up big meals, why not go the extra kilometer and make some things that are freezer friendly? This can be leftovers (if your recipe freezes well), a batch of freezer burritos (don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got a recipe for you) or breakfast muffins (regular muffins, or egg \u201cmuffins\u201d, or even donut muffins. I couldn\u2019t choose my&nbsp;favorite, but there are many recipes online).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The best part - if you spend a little time creating these freezer meals, you have several options to grab, nuke, and go for those days when you don\u2019t have the time or energy to get in the kitchen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6627,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/6Try-a-theme-day-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Man holding plate of tacos\" class=\"wp-image-6627\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>6 - <strong>Try a Theme Day!&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For an easy jumping off point in your meal planning, slot in a Theme Day (the term for this is actually Meal Templates, but that is not as fun as a Theme Day).&nbsp;We always think of Taco Tuesday, but you could do Mexican Monday or Curry Thursday. Your Theme can be whatever you like - it doesn\u2019t even have to start with the same letter as the day! Pick a couple of categories you like and plan on them once a week. Fun!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of focal point is helpful when you\u2019re meal planning. You\u2019re basically narrowing down the field from&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;<\/em>the recipes to a specific category of recipes to choose from. If you know that you\u2019re having pasta on Friday you only need to decide whether you\u2019re making that decadent carbonara or a lasagna that could feed you through the weekend (or freezes really well).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>7- <strong>Rely on your tried-and-true recipes.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We all have our go-to meals, the ones we keep coming back to again and again. Well, they\u2019re&nbsp;popular&nbsp;for a reason! It\u2019s not necessary to get a roster of brand-new recipes every week. On nights when you\u2019re busy with other things or you just want something easy or familiar, rely on those recipes that you know will not fail you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My current easy, throw-together meal is a cucumber and tomato salad (and yes, you can have this recipe too). It\u2019s super versatile and as simple as chopping up some veg, throwing that into a bowl and eating!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>8 - <strong>Try new things.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the internet, we no longer need to rely on our mothers\u2019 hand-me-down cookbook for recipes (though do keep that close by). It\u2019s easy to search for a recipe for almost anything and find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are even websites where you plug in the ingredients you want to use, and it will return a list of options for you! (Reverse lookup for recipes? Yes, please!). Personally, I\u2019m a big fan of All Recipes where people share their own recipes and others can review them. You can see pictures, read about how it turned out, and what you might want to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One sneaky little trick (a&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;of my mother\u2019s) is to regularly patrol the send-you-meal-ingredients-in-a-box service websites. There is often a cache of recipes that rotates with what they\u2019re currently offering. You can snag those tasty recipes and then buy your own ingredients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6628,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/9Prep-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Chopped vegetables on the board\" class=\"wp-image-6628\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>9 - <strong>Prep ingredients in advance.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of knowing what you\u2019ll be making is figuring out what ingredients you need ahead of time. This makes it easy to chop up a bunch of vegetables whenever you have a spare 10 minutes, and have them ready to go. If you can\u2019t imagine where you\u2019d get a spare 10 minutes, set aside a dedicated half hour at some point in the week instead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If all your onions, peppers and garlic are already chopped, you can throw them straight into the pan without worrying about the prep work. Trust me, you\u2019ll thank your past self for your forethought.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>So...<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meal planning seems like a lot of work. And don\u2019t get me wrong, it&nbsp;<em>is<\/em>&nbsp;still work. But the amount of time you put into it easily pays itself back and then some when you no longer need to waffle (mmm\u2026 waffles) over what you are going to make for breakfast, lunch and dinner each and every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cooking is creative - have fun with it! I like to use versatile recipes that can be catered to my own tastes. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment - adjust the seasonings to your preference. If you hate bell peppers but love carrots, swap them out. Not all your experiments will turn out to be amazing, but some of them will.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I\u2019ve got a few recipes to get you started. These are my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;versions of these recipes, and I can tell you that&nbsp;<em>I<\/em>&nbsp;love them, but make your own adjustments as you see fit.

Goodbye winter jackets and hello spring dresses. Who doesn\u2019t love the smell of freshly cut grass in the air? The sight of colorful flowers finally popping up in the soil?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spring is one of the most awaited seasons for most of us in Winnipeg. Winters are too cold and summers can sometimes be too hot. With limited mobility though, some of us might not feel as excited to greet the season as others normally do. But have no fear! There is still a lot to do in the city! And downtown has some attractive places to offer!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First of all, look at that sun shining. And a quick check at the weather app confirms it is 20 degrees. A warm day means it\u2019s the perfect time to try out some new ice cream flavors. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feteicecreamcoffee.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">F\u00eate on Assiniboine Avenue<\/a> is a cute little ice cream shop that boasts of not only great ice cream, but amazing coffee, cakes and waffle crisps (I didn\u2019t know this was a thing, but it is! And this taste delicious with ice cream).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bonus? You can take a stroll in the park next door as you enjoy your favorite flavor of ice cream. Bonnycastle Park also has a little dog park in the vicinity, so it\u2019s a great spot to go to for you and your furry pal to enjoy a sweet treat.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6739,\"width\":761,\"height\":428,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220.png\" alt=\"Dog Running in the field\" class=\"wp-image-6739\" width=\"761\" height=\"428\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another favorite ice cream spot is <a href=\"https:\/\/chaebanicecream.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chaeban on Osbsorne<\/a>. They have some amazing flavors with very wholesome ingredients. I kid you not, I could taste real mint leaves in their mint ice cream. Their outdoor sitting area offers the perfect opportunity to enjoy a relaxed evening outdoors just enjoying the hustle and bustle of downtown while having a heavenly treat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another sough after landmark to enjoy the season is the Forks Market. You can pop inside the market to check out stores that offer unique handmade items or simply roam around the Commons to grab a drink and enjoy the sun. The area also offers a scenic view and a track along the river where you can bike or jog to soak up some sun.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In fact, if you enjoy history there are some great monuments to see. And if you\u2019re more into modern art, they\u2019ve recently set up the \u2018Forever Bicycles\u2019 monument along with other art pieces to view. If you have little kids to entertain alongside, they have great play structures and a splash pad to cool off after all the walking.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Walking alongside the Riverwalk at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theforks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Forks <\/a>can take you to another landmark in downtown, the Legislative Building. With its extensive gardens and fountain, you can not only get a scenic view to enjoy a cup of coffee, but also admire the structure of the Legislative Building itself with the golden boy shining in all his glory. It makes for a lovely backdrop for some great pictures, especially during sunset.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg also offers an opportunity to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.exchangedistrict.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">visit the Exchange District<\/a>, very close to the intersection of Portage and Main, one of the most popular intersections in all of Canada. The Exchange District has heritage buildings so if you\u2019re looking for a sneak peek into the city\u2019s past, it\u2019s the perfect twenty blocks for a stroll. You can expect to see restaurants, theatres and the Old Market Square with its quaint backdrop. &nbsp;Each structure has a story to tell, if we only have the time to listen.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you\u2019re not a history or art buff like me, and prefer instead to be surrounded by nature, maybe listening to some water flowing or birds chirping then I have a great spot for you. But where will you find a spot like that in downtown amidst all the hustle and bustle of Main Street? Not too far I promise. In fact, it\u2019s in our very own downtown.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[6741],\"linkTo\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6741\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974.png\" data-link=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/?attachment_id=6741\" class=\"wp-image-6741\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the idea of sitting on a picnic blanket and sipping some lemonade sounds appealing to you then look no further, and I mean literally!

Then suddenly, your life is in upheaval and your vision for the future needs to change. It\u2019s stressful and kind of scary. And it sucks.

		"content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Winnipeg in summer can be a glorious place. We get lots of sunshine and there are plenty of things to do. Many people think of great summer adventures outside of our city, as we have wonderful parks and other outdoor spaces. But don\u2019t be fooled. Downtown has its charms and attractions too.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, if you are living in or visiting downtown Winnipeg on a fine summer\u2019s day, where should you start?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The Forks<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The Forks is wonderful year-round. There is the fabulous indoor market. The Common now serves libations both indoors and out. You can pull up a Muskoka chair and sit around a fire in the evening, or you can walk along the riverfront. You can watch the boats go by, spy on the ducks and geese and even fish right off the Riverwalk. I\u2019ve seen many a catfish pulled out of the water right by the docks. There are beautiful gardens and the Oodena to walk through. It takes an awful long time to get bored at the Forks, and it doesn\u2019t cost you any money to wander around.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6854,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Forks-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6854\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Parks<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Forks isn\u2019t the only pretty outdoor space downtown. Upper Fort Garry Provincial Park is tiny but lovely. You will find it at the corner of Main St. and Assiniboine. There is a small remnant of the fort, comfortable and original seating, and a lightshow every evening. If you bring your furry friend, you can cross Assiniboine and enter downtown\u2019s Bonnycastle Dog Park. It\u2019s nice to know not every part of downtown is a concrete jungle.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Downtown Winnipeg Farmer\u2019s Market<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Looking for fresh produce? You don\u2019t need to leave downtown. During the warm months, you can trek over to the Downtown Winnipeg Farmer\u2019s Market. Its current home is in True North Square. You will find it open every Thursday from 10am to 2:30pm, with all sorts of fresh produce sold from local farmers. You can also find baked goods, jams, honeys, cheese, crafts and other fun stuff. It\u2019s wonderful being able to shop in the open air.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6855,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Yoga-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6855\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Fitness in the Park<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you overindulge in the baked goods at the market, you might consider joining Fitness in the Park for one of their many sessions. They offer free lunch classes every weekday. They use multiple locations, so this is also a nice way to get to know downtown Winnipeg\u2019s green spaces. Currently, Fitness uses the Legislative grounds, Memorial Park, and the Millennium Library grounds for classes. Their main focuses are yoga and Morfit. It\u2019s nice to get a midday break from being cooped up indoors and it\u2019s a great way to keep fit. To learn more about the program, visit the Downtown Winnipeg Biz site.

You can sign up for one of their historic walking tours (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.exchangedistrict.org\/historic-walking-tours\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.exchangedistrict.org\/historic-walking-tours\/<\/a> ). Or you could just take yourself around. There are funky shops to visit and eateries aplenty, from poutine to fancy cuisine. Lose yourself on the winding streets and pretend you are visiting a city from a hundred years ago. The heritage buildings are delightful and a photographer\u2019s dream. We are lucky that Winnipeg\u2019s stalled economic progression from last century left us this beautiful legacy.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6856,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Garden-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6856\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Gardens<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Do you like flowers and pretty foliage? Who doesn\u2019t? While you can see some lovely examples at the parks already mentioned, there are two other places downtown that are worth a visit. The Manitoba Legislature and surrounding buildings are lovely all year, but summer adds a pretty splash of colour. From the Leg, you can also walk down to the Riverwalk and enjoy the Assiniboine River.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From the Leg, it\u2019s a short walk to Dalnavert Museum on Carlton St. You may know it for its indoor tours of life in the 1800s, but the outdoor grounds are also worth a viewing. You can do a self-guided garden tour in the summertime. The gardens surround the house and are divided into six distinctive areas. Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.friendsofdalnavert.ca<\/a> for more details.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Boat Tours<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you get sick of using your feet, you can head back to where you started, the Forks, for a river tour. Splash Dash is at it again this summer. You can book a ticket on their boats and cruise both the Assiniboine and Red, while learning a dash of history from your driver. Covid has changed their rules a little, but you can still book in with a group for a relaxing tour. Check them out at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.splashdash.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.splashdash.ca<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Bonus Material Future Summer Events<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I know we said seven, but let\u2019s add an eighth reason to visit downtown \u2014 patios! Yep, downtown Winnipeg is chock full of them. Big ones, small ones, even rooftop ones. If you are looking for inspiration, check out the recent Patio Fest put on by Downtown Winnipeg Biz for location inspiration.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6857,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Patio-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6857\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And finally, while Covid still has many attractions closed, some will return later this summer and others will return next year. The Winnipeg Art Gallery, with its beautiful new Qaumajuq exhibit showcasing Inuit art, will likely be open by summer\u2019s end, as will the Manitoba Museum. Once sporting events are back, it\u2019s always a treat to take in a Winnipeg Goldeyes baseball game.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Fish have an exceptional baseball park just across from the Forks. I don\u2019t know about you, but I certainly miss stadium popcorn, hot dogs and drinks. Other events, like outdoor movies, might also return, making downtown an even more happening place. And if you live downtown, you don\u2019t even need to worry about parking. That sounds rather ideal to me.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Truly, the place combines a coffee shop with a vivid hipster vibe on the main floor and a rooftop patio bar that overlooks Exchange District. In fact, the best time to visit the rooftop is right before the sunset hour. When golden sunlight touches downtown buildings, old and new alike, one no longer has a feeling that tomorrow is another workday; on the contrary, at the Forth rooftop bar, one feels like on a vacation.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As for the food and drinks options, you can order such quick snacks as avocado toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, croissants, yogurt parfait and others, while the bar on the roof offers craft cocktails.

The building still presents a high ceiling, massive windows, and brick walls: altogether, with a simple yet elegant interior, it creates a unique atmosphere.

Even though Browns Socialhouse belongs to a chain brand, according to many customers\u2019 reviews it is one of the favourite places among locals.

Be warned that if you opt to make them yourself, rice paper wraps are delicate and can be difficult to work with. They\u2019re always tasty but often mine aren\u2019t what you\u2019d call <em>pretty<\/em>. You may want to try out a few before making a batch to present to the family.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is home to some outstanding Vietnamese restaurants.

I suggest:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Devilled Eggs<\/strong> - If there was ever a time for the return of this devillishy delectable appetizer it\u2019s now. Half a hard-boiled egg filled with creamy, seasoned yolk is a tantalizing, two bite snack. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve not made these myself. But, as someone who very much wants to eat these, I strongly encourage this choice.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If that isn\u2019t your style, how about...<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers<\/strong> - These I <em>have<\/em> made, and they\u2019re legendary (or maybe legen-DAIRY!

To make these:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Gut your jalapenos.<ol><li>I recommend wearing disposable gloves for this. Cut them in half and remove the pith (white bit) and seeds to reduce the worst of the heat.<\/li><\/ol><ol><li>If you\u2019re really spice intolerant (like me) you can place the de-seeded peppers in boiling water for a few minutes to mellow them out.<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li>Fill them with a combination of your favorite cheeses.<ol><li>I recommend mixing shreds of a strong flavoured cheese like a smoked gouda or fresh parmesan up with some cream cheese, salt, and pepper for a scoopable cheesy filling.<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li>Wrap the filled jalapeno halves with a strip of bacon and secure with a toothpick.<ol><li>You still want it to be pliable enough to wrap, but I recommend partially cooking the bacon first to cut down on finishing time later.<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li>Bake in the oven or set on the grill until the bacon is fully cooked and voil\u00e0! You can\u2019t go wrong with bacon and cheese.<\/li><\/ol>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don\u2019t have the time or the gumption for all that work, here are some simpler and just as appetizing appetizers:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Corn on the cob<\/strong> - This straightforward and classic BBQ staple is great on its own or can be jazzed up a ton of different ways. Try adding ingredients like lime juice and sweet chili sauce, or ranch and cheddar.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[6923],\"linkTo\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/pineapple.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6923\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/pineapple.png\" data-link=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/?attachment_id=6923\" class=\"wp-image-6923\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Grilled Pineapple<\/strong> - Slice off rounds of this hearty fruit and throw them on the grill.

But if you want to avoid the usual burger assembly with shared condiments and a pile of communal lettuce, may I suggest:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Stuffed Peppers <\/em><\/strong>- robust self-contained meals that need no accoutrement.

I did a combination of pulled pork, mushrooms, and rice last week and they were <em>amazing!<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The key when grilling these is to make sure that the filling isn\u2019t runny so it doesn\u2019t all pour out when you tip it on its side. I recommend cooking these for a bit in a pan or on the cool side of the grill to soften the peppers, and then finishing them off over the flames for those ever-appealing grill lines.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Desserts<\/strong><\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was so hard not to focus this whole thing on desserts. I recognize that people like to eat other things too, but why bother when you could just have dessert?!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you\u2019re a baker, cakes and pies can be scaled down to <strong>cupcakes or tarts<\/strong>. I really like the idea of having a whole (albeit tiny) pie all to myself! Everyone loves a cupcake, and I\u2019ve got a foolproof recipe to please any crowd. For a ridiculously simple and customizable cupcake:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Take a box of white cake mix and ignoring the additional ingredients it calls for, combine it with any 355 ml can of soda you like to make the batter.<\/li><li>Then, dish the batter into your pans and bake according to the box instructions for a soft, fluffy, and soda flavored cake.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I made a batch of root beer float cupcakes this way and topped them with homemade swiss meringue buttercream frosting (which held up impeccably in the heat!). Don\u2019t worry, a can of your favorite store bought frosting will work just as well.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For something a little lighter, Pinterest inspired an <strong>ice cream cone fruit salad <\/strong>which is (as you might expect) an ice cream cone filled with whatever fruits and berries you like. Top them with a little of <strong>Mama Dawn\u2019s Famous Fruit Dip<\/strong>. It\u2019s a quick recipe:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Take a 250 ml container of sour cream and stir in 2 tablespoons of brown sugar until completely combined.<\/li><li>Taste and add additional sugar if desired.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, Downtown Winnipeg hosts a plethora of fantastic bakeries and confectionery shops where you can pick up a stunning contribution to the party with none of that extra effort.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And there is one more very important food category that has not been addressed yet:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6924,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/kebab2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6924\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Anything on a stick!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Kebabs<\/strong> are the ultimate individual BBQ food, and if you can put it on a stick, it can be kebab\u2019d.

		"content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is something about fall that brings Winnipeg to life more than any other season. It is a great time full of crisp excellent weather, beautiful fall scenery, and best of all, the fact that Halloween is hiding right around the corner! With this haunted holiday creeping closer it is no doubt that people are very eager to get out and get spooky! With so many fun events to celebrate the season popping up, there are lots of ways to get the heebie-jeebies! While all these events are amazing, pet owners don't want their dogs to miss out by having to leave them at home. Like every holiday, pet owners want to enjoy this time of year with the company of their canine companions to enjoy the haunted times and beautiful weather together.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first thought, it may not seem like Halloween would be the best time to be bringing your dog with you. On second thought, it is the best idea! There are plenty of ways to have a haunted Halloween with your pup, even with the conditions of 2021. If you have been wondering if there is anything you can do with your dog this Halloween season, we have you covered. Check out this list of 7 pet-friendly ways to celebrate Halloween this year!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7091,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/dog1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7091\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. Trick-<em>and<\/em>-Treat<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Trick and Treating is a tasty (for your dog anyway) and fun (for you both) way to kick of the Halloween season! They say that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but I beg to differ. It is never too late to teach any age dog, any trick! With a little bit of encouragement and the right motivation, they'll have it in no time. Get into the spirit with your dog by trick-<em>and<\/em>-treat training. Look up some tasty treats (preferably that use up all that delicious excess pumpkin from your pumpkin carving), make your pet some haunted Halloween-themed treats, and teach them some spooky new tricks. There are many easy-to-make Halloween-themed dog treat recipes out there for you to make for your pup's trick and treat training! There are many upsides to making your dog treats too. You know and control what is in them and the portion. Home-made treats are a healthier alternative to store-bought, especially when it comes to training sessions where your lucky dog is sure to reap consecutive treat rewards.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While you're finding the perfect recipe, you can also find countless Halloween themed tricks out there you can teach your dog as well. Alternatively, it is just as easy for you to modify their favorites with a creepy spin. Try starting with easier tricks they might already know like \"Find The Bones\" (or any other Halloween-inspired command works). The idea is to hide a prop bone, hand, skeleton, whatever is going to work with your dog, and train them to go to it when you ask them to \"Find the Bones.\" Most dogs already know some version of \"find me your or where is your toy\" and will pick this up quickly. Another great set of tricks that is also really easy to teach and for your dog to learn is Play Dead &amp; Rise From The Dead. Playing dead is already an easy classic to teach your dog, or that you might have already. Try giving it a creepy spin by adding \"Rise From the Dead\" or \"Resurrect\" as a command for your dog to get back up, after playing dead! Your ol' dog's new tricks are sure to surprise you, and your baking skills may pleasantly surprise you both. One thing to remember is if you are using new toys, decorations, props, and ingredients, make sure that they are safe for your pet.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. Do a Photoshoot!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is fun any time of the year, or day for that matter to take pictures of our pets, isn't it? There is something fun and exciting in the holiday season about being able to dress you or your dog (or both) up in costumes, with no judgment from the internet. Take full advantage of doing a Halloween photoshoot with your dog! You will love the photos and the memories, and your dog is sure to love the outside playtime and extra attention! Pack your pup an adorable costume (again no judgment in two or three) and take them on an outdoor adventure to the perfect spot for your fall shoot! Once you find your set, try letting your dog explore and play in their costume while you take great action shots. But what's better than a few cute pictures of your dog? Great photos of you and your dog, of course! Get in the spirit and join the photoshoot yourself and take some doggy-owner shots together. Try doing a matching or themed costume for added cute points on social media! Not sure of what to dress up as for your fall shoot? Try one of these classic human &amp; dog costume pairs like Cop &amp; Robber, Dorothy &amp; Todo, Shaggy &amp; Scooby, Charlie Brown &amp; Snoopy, just for some suggestions. Make sure you bring some of your Halloween treats as a reward and toys as encouragement for those criminally cute Halloween-themed shots!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7092,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/dog2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7092\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. Pup-kins<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can't talk about celebrating Halloween without Pumpkins! Whether you're putting them on your porch or in a pie, they're fun to carve, bake, and even more, fun to pick yourself. There are many pet-friendly pumpkin picking patches. Pick the perfect pumpkins for all your decorating, carving, and baking needs alongside your favorite animal helper. You and your dog will love the time in nature, and your pet will love playing with and eating them. Challenge yourself by trying to carve one that looks just like your puppy for their very own pup-kin, a bonus that they make great Halloween decor for your pet party!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. Have a pet costume party!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Have you ever wanted to be in a room full of dogs in costumes? Make that adorable fantasy an even cuter reality by getting you and your doggies BFFs (best furry friends) together for a fun Halloween pet party! Get the gang together in their favorite costumes for some scary good times! It's a fun reason to get together and a great way for your dogs to get some socialization. If you're not sure what to do at your puppy party, just try any of the activities on this list. Things like costumes, doggie bobbing, and pup-kin carving make great contests and photoshoots are an adorable way to have a howl at your party. Your Halloween pet party is the perfect place for your old dogs to show off their new tricks and for you to show off your new baking skills and tasty treats with your pack!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7093,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/dog3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7093\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. Get out for a fright night!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You don't have to leave your best friend at home to check out scary events and to have a haunted Halloween. And it certainly isn't Halloween if you aren't getting a good scare in! Many of Winnipeg's favorite things to do like corn mazes, the zoo, pumpkin picking patches are pet friendly! Just make sure you check before you go, and make sure you know it's not going to be too much for your pup. You want to be scared, not your dog.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. Doggie Bobbing!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sounds similar to the long-standing tradition of bobbing for apples right? You get buckets full of water, throw some apples in, and usually run a contest between a few people to see who can get them all out the fastest. Both harder than it looks and wildly entertaining to watch, it's a time-tested favorite for a reason!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Try giving this old favorite a cute twist by letting your puppy-pal try their paw at doggie bobbing! If you don't want to use apples or you have a smaller dog, you can use tennis balls or pool toys. If it's just you and your pooch, fill one bin or a bucket that is a good size for your dog with water, toss in some floating treats, toys, apples, and watch and be howling in laughter! If your dog doesn't start bobbing for apples at the sight of the bucket- don't panic. You may have to encourage your pup by showing them what to do and that it is there for them!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>7. Trick-Or-Treat \/ Halloween Dog Walk<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last but never least, celebrate Halloween the way it is intended to be celebrated, with actual trick-or-treating! Dress you and your dog up in amazing costumes, walk the neighborhood enjoying the costumes, decorations, and maybe trick-or-treating a little. If you don't want to go real trick-or-treating you can check out pet-friendly places like pet stores, dog parks, and other puppy permitted places! You are sure to score some tasty treats for your dog (and not to mention candy for yourself) they will be expected to show off some of those spooky tricks so be ready!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

The dry air and fewer hours of light aren't the best environments for most plants. However, some indoor household plants are best suited for even the chillier rooms. Check out the top 6 cold-tolerant plants that are sure to make your house cozier and brighter.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Snake Plant<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7206,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/plan1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7206\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Snake plant (Sansevieria) can resist low light, cool temperatures, and dry soil.

This plant likes consistent sunlight, so it is recommended to place it in a south-facing window.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

The stores are buzzing, your online shopping wishlist has been sent to Santa, everyone has booked their tickets home, and oops, you\u2019ve got two weeks to plan a Christmas party! What better way is there to ring in the holiday than with your best and brightest around a table for a couple of sips and a few bites to eat, right?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With your date set, the guest list firm, and the invitations sent, it\u2019s time to narrow in on the details of this party. These holiday themes are packaged and paired nicely with your food, decoration, and activity options. While Christmas is a theme of its own, changing things up will help to keep things fresh and make your party stand out. I am offering this list of party ideas to help you ramp up your holiday season as you get ready to wind down the year.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7268,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Xmasparty1-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7268\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RWG Christmas<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I said, Christmas is its own theme and allows you to keep it easy by grabbing all the green, gold, white, and red you can from any of your local shops. Seven-foot self-lighting tree? Check. Popcorn tinsel? Done. An RWG Christmas (red, white, and green) gives you the chance to slide into the holiday season easily with pre-packaged d\u00e9cor and maybe a pine branch or two from your local coniferous.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Decorations: Try making your space look more festive with some traditional Christmas garnishes. Hang a stocking by the fire (or TV stand), throw up some mistletoe (for that special someone who walks through the door), and grab a couple of empty boxes to wrap and place beneath your tree.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Food: You can\u2019t do traditional Christmas without a Christmas ham or turkey. For those looking for a vegetarian option, why not try a nut loaf as a savory alternative. For those who want to keep it simple, try one of the holiday feature meal kits from local restaurants like <a href=\"https:\/\/localpubliceatery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Local Public Eatery<\/a>. Pair your dinner with your favorite sides like mash potatoes, some greens, and a dinner roll (or two). Pick up a bottle of wine from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ellementwine.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ellement<\/a> at the Forks. Wrap this meal up with some holiday sweets from local bakeries like <a href=\"https:\/\/tallgrassbakery.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tall Grass Prairie<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xn--gtowpg-wta.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gato Bakeshop<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Activities: Keep friends and family entertained with an ugly sweater contest or a gingerbread house-building competition.

Think New Years' Eve at Christmas!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Decorations: While a classic pine is usually a go-to, an all-white tree will allow your Tinsel and Tinis party to shine. Dress it up with some silver and white decorations that shimmer like the snow on a sunny day. Pair this with a tinsel garland held together with a few logs of white birch and a couple of soy candles from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coalandcanary.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Coal and Canary<\/a>. Tip: add in some hints of gold and pine green to tie this look together.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Food: A Tinsel and Tini party is all about the Martinis. Test out your bartending skills with a few different options like this <a href=\"https:\/\/inspiredbycharm.com\/white-christmas-martini\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">White Martini<\/a> from Inspired Charm or these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.townandcountrymag.com\/leisure\/drinks\/g2881\/christmas-martinis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">holiday-inspired mixes<\/a> posted by Town &amp; Country. As for what to eat? Do dinner differently with a choose-your-own-adventure tapas bar. &nbsp;Keep it Christmas by throwing in some slices of turkey, a few dinner rolls, and some green and red olives. Top off the platter with some white chocolate bark or macaroons from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.caroonbymj.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Caroon by MJ<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Activities: Keep this party focussed on the sips and dips by hosting a DIY martini bar!

Think sugar plum fairies, kingdoms and crowns, and a magic wand to bring it all to life.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Decorations: As with most of these themes, it starts with a tree, and this time, the bigger, the better. Dress your majestic coniferous in gold and wrap the base in crimson. Flank this tree with a couple of nutcracker soldiers, throw on some candy canes and add an angel on top. Hang those stockings and use a bit of extra fabric to create a luxurious garland for your \u201cfireplace\u201d. The key to this Christmas theme is decadence and extravagance. Make this party feel authentic by picking up a few antiques from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thingsforrwb.com\/?fbclid=IwAR0S4bGw8NmQXGkstmSPZXXLDCqKBrsirUodsSPo1lgxDmtvcWvomNqOR28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Things by RWB<\/a>. Remember to watch out for that Rat King though, he might try to steal all your goods.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Food: Get into the theme by trying a few meat pies from local vendor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mollysmeatpies.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Molly\u2019s Meat Pies<\/a>. Pair these with some mushroom soup (my favorite is from <a href=\"https:\/\/earls.ca\/locations\/main-street\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Earl\u2019s on Main Street<\/a>!) and a side of green beans. Grab a sip of your favorite vodka and try your hand at some homemade marzipan or sugar plums. Or you could just eat the candy canes.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Activities: What better way to get into character than by hosting a dress-up party? Have people come in their best nutcracker-inspired couture and dance the night away. You could even throw in a crown-making activity to see who really will be crowned the next Rat King!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7272,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Xmasparty4-1-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7272\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>True North<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Looking for something a bit more low-key? Why not think about an all-Canadian Christmas theme that screams cozy and cute with a little bit of camp? That\u2019s right, we are talking about plaid wrapped in twine and drizzled in snowflakes.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Decorations: Get that tree up and dress it in plaid and gold ribbons and bows. Feel free to paint the tips with a bit of white to make it look like it has just snowed. Those plaid stockings with the buck cut-out hung together with a few strings of twine would make a fine addition. If you want to get into the spirit, why not up the ante with a couple of hand-carved pieces from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wag.ca\/qaumajuq\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Winnipeg Art Gallery<\/a> in support of the new Qaumajuq gallery.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Food: Is it too much of a clich\u00e9 to call on poutine, Bannock, and bacon, and beers? I don\u2019t think so. Stay cozy and homey by serving up these Canadian favorites with a side of split pea soup. To end the evening, fire up the kettle and serve a round of hot toddies (maple syrup required) with a couple of butter tarts.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Activities: Who can say no to a poutine station? Head down to the <a href=\"https:\/\/thecheesemongers.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cheesemongers Fromagerie<\/a> on Corydon and pick up some of your favorite poutine toppings.

		"content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For me, winter is a time that is defined by two words: comfort and cozy. I prefer to hunker down for the cold months and try learning a couple of new things. That is how I found myself in a slow cooker frenzy and boldly declaring, \u201cI will never use another device again\u201d. The convenience of one-pot meals and the diversity of use make the slow cooker one of my favorite cooking tools. It is slow to warm up, but once it does, things get hot. That is why I am presenting you with five great ways to use your slow cooker to turn up the cozy this winter season.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7321,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/sc1-1024x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7321\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Dessert for breakfast?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love warm oatmeal in the winter to kickstart my day. The rich nuttiness of the oats with some milk and a bit of brown sugar are undefeated against a cold winter morning. A slow cooker is best for cooking steel-cut oats that are a bit denser and can keep the chewiness after being cooked over a long period. On average, you will want to use 3 \u00bd to 4 cups of liquid for every one cup of oats depending on the size of your cooker and your desired texture.\u00a0 For the liquid, you can use water or any of your favorite kinds of milk. I prefer a mix of almond milk and coconut milk. After that, it is just choosing your toppings! From classics like pecans and raisins to items like carrot and coconut chips, oatmeal allows you to mix and match to your heart's content. Don\u2019t forget to throw in a sweetener of choice and a few herbs or spices like cardamom or nutmeg. Get creative and try something new. Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ihearteating.com\/overnight-crock-pot-carrot-cake-oatmeal\/\">overnight slow cooker carrot cake oatmeal<\/a> recipe by Kate Dean from I Heart Eating and try a little dessert for breakfast this winter.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Beans will make you dance<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>COVID brought on a lot of changes for everyone. For me, given the extra time I had at home, I decided to transition into a vegetarian lifestyle. What this meant was experimenting with new recipes and very often, beans. Cue the slow cooker. Over the last year, I have tried a variety of slow cooker bean dishes from chili to stew. Now, when I think about a go-to slow cooker meal, I immediately think of a warm chickpea coconut curry! This dish is a staple in my meal plan, popping up every couple of months. The rich curry flavor always transports me to another, much warmer, place, and in the dead of winter, that is where I want to be. Served on a bed of rice or with a side of naan bread, this dish is all comfort. I often pair mine with some garlic roasted green beans or oven-roasted broccoli. To get your curry on, pick up some potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, ginger, and coconut milk. Again, thanks to the one-pot meal idea, all you have to do is prep the veggies and dump them all into the pot.

But did you know that your slow cooker can also make a variety of desserts and types of bread? That\u2019s right, brownies, focaccia, French toast, and cakes can all be prepared in a slow cooker. As a big fan of dessert, slow cooker puddings and pies have been an exciting new way to cook some of my favorite sweets. I find that cooking with a slow cooker means that burning my baking is much less likely thanks to the slow cooking time. I also love that using the slow cooker frees up the oven for other tasks, which comes in handy during the busy Christmas baking season. Making dessert in a slow cooker is a bit more involved than a one-pot meal. You still need to prep the ingredients outside of the pot as you normally would, but then you can stick it into the pot to cook.

While I often choose a cup of tea, sometimes I like to change things up. Hot toddies mulled wines, and boozy hot chocolates are all beverages that help warm me up while I wind down. These are also all drinks that can easily be prepared in a slow cooker! I mix mine at lunch which guarantees an after-dinner serving time that is still hot out the pot. With slow cooker beverages, we can return to the one-pot meal idea and get creative with mix-ins. Want to try a mint hot chocolate, or ginger-spiced mulled wine? You can easily adapt any base recipe with your favorite flavors. Just stay open to the possibilities and adjust along the way.

But to create that real winter hygge (a Danish word meaning a quality of coziness and comfort that creates a feeling of contentment or well-being according to dictionary.com) you need to set the scene. While your slow cooker can make food items, it can also make candles, lotion bars, and soaps! That\u2019s right, you can set the scene for your winter wonderland with these DIY household items. When creating a non-food product in your cooker, you will want to be sure to use a liner where possible to avoid cross-contamination and for easy clean-up. These are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased online or from the kitchen aisle in your local grocery store. I love candle-making. They make great gifts, are pretty easy to make, and they smell great! Soaps and lotion bars are also great gift ideas and allow you to exercise your creative side.

With all the lockdown and pandemic talk (still) happening, this might be more difficult than in previous years. Are the gyms going to close again? Will I be able to start that new food lifestyle? Will I even be able to make it to Tulum this year?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While we all wait for that \"new normal,\" we have the opportunity to reframe how we experience where we are now. For me, 2021 presented me with the chance to rethink resolutions. I decided to focus on building in more holistic practices rather than individual goals. I swapped out \"gym three times a week\" with \"move daily.\" Building better habits into day-to-day activities allowed me to actually hold to my new year's resolutions. Because of this, I have been happier and healthier this year.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7342,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/b2-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7342\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Below are five resolutions worth keeping and implementing into your daily life. There are a few things to remember when setting any resolutions. First, set a limit on how many goals you are looking to make. Next, make your resolutions specific. When I changed my resolution to moving daily, I also made sure to add for a minimum of 15 min a day. For all you fitness buffs, I know 15 min is about half of the recommended movement time, but the pandemic was hard and, I sat a lot. This brings me to the next point, start small.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Very few of us can successfully go from 0 to 100 overnight. By the end of 2021, I was moving for over an hour a day, but I started at 15 minutes. Finally, stay open and get help. Having an accountability partner (or app) helps hold you to your goals. The extra support is helpful when those resolutions start to feel hard. Change can be challenging. Having someone to support you through change is an important aspect of success.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are a few resolutions to help you along your journey in 2022. Good luck, you've got this! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Move<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I said, this is not a traditional resolution of going to the gym three times a week. This resolution is just about moving your body, even if it is up and down the hallways a couple of times. The past few years have been passed sitting in a chair sitting for many people. It's time to get active again. The physical and mental benefits of activity of any type are important, but how we get the activity is less important.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7337,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/b3-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7337\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My dad always parks in the furthest spot at the store so he can get his steps in. I prefer a dance party in the living room. It doesn't always have to be treadmills and barbells. The key to this resolution is to commit to moving your body regularly simply. Let the type of movement you are doing evolve as you get stronger and keep going.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Pay it forward<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This resolution is all about finding space to give back. The pandemic has been draining for many people. Some of us have experienced it much worse than others. I know that every canceled holiday plan has been exhausting for me. This is why acts of kindness need to be built into your new year. Think about those videos of people buying meals for someone they have never met or pets howling, \"I love you.\"<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7338,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/b4-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7338\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Those little moments where you want to say, \"aww, that's so sweet.\" Try building in a giving practice into your new year. We need more kind moments to continue through the pandemic. Try leaving a note (or text) for someone you know has been having a hard time. Donate to or volunteer for a local organization. Or call your mom.

		"content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spending more time at home has probably meant that you have had more time to rethink your space. Do you have enough storage? Is there a better place to put that shelf? How many times can someone rearrange their living room? <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7434,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/NL6-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7434\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you got into the online and bulk shopping craze, organizing and optimizing your space has likely become a priority. Having an organized space helps get all that stuff out of the way while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellmind.com\/why-an-organized-home-aids-relaxation-3144742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">improving your mental health<\/a>. Maximizing space becomes an even more important feature in an apartment setting if you lack in-building storage or live with others.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tackling the mess can be overwhelming. The key to getting it done is starting small and applying the same principles to each space as you go along. There really can be a method to the madness! Here are a few tips to keep your area organized, starting in a more inconspicuous part of your house \u2013 your linen closet.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first step to keeping any space clean is to purge. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.organizedinteriors.com\/blog\/home-organization-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">research<\/a>, we only use about 20% of the things we own. So what happens to the other 80%? It is probably in a storage unit or the back of a closet if you're like me. We all do it. You know the shirt in the back that you wore once to the festival you never went to again. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, your linen closet is probably hiding secrets of a past self, saying, \"one day I will &lt;insert idea here&gt;.\" Purging will give you the space to evaluate what is essential and what to dump. The cup of buttons I found in the back of my linen closet quickly became an art project. Get crafty with things you can't bring yourself to throw out. Another option is to recycle what is still usable for someone else. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Try looking up places in your city that will recycle odds and ends. Small appliances, electronics, and old smoke alarms can go to local <a href=\"https:\/\/greendeal.ca\/recycling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">green recycling depots<\/a>. So, grab a couple of bins and start throwing things over your shoulder like a 90s cartoon. Here is a tip: if you have to ask, \"what was this for again?\" then it is probably not something you need.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7438,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/NL8-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7438\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Purging is only the first step. It prepares you for the next stage of this project \u2013 sorting through what you want to keep. This is the part where you go back to grade two math and start pairing like items with like items. Put all the towels in one pile, then the lint rollers in another. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you are happy with your groups, start putting things into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/ca\/en\/cat\/clothes-boxes-10565\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">closet-organizing storage bins<\/a> of different shapes and sizes. Storage bins help to create dedicated spaces that help control clutter. Containers with lids or stackable bins also help to create more vertical space in your closet and more room to play with. Having dedicated compartments for specific things also helps with the visual appeal of the closet. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They give the illusion of organization even if the bin is just stray pins and random items. That said, I like a bin-in-bin situation where each of my small-item buckets contains several other open top-boxes for things like clothespins and laundry bags.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to storage boxes, try out some space-saving bags, hooks, and shelves to maximize space while reducing mess. Wire shelving again helps with creating vertical space on your shelves. I like to roll my linens to help with organization. With tall and deep closet shelves, this means that I can have towels underneath the wire shelf and face towels on top (organized by color, of course). <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Vertical space is essential if you have a multi-person home or do not have a lot of storage space. You can also test out vacuum seal bags to give you even more room. Finally, wall hooks and Velcro strips allow you to hang things on the back of the door or the sidewall.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7437,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/NL7-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7437\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It isn't enough to only have the bins in place. If you want to stay organized and keep everyone at home in the loop, it is important to label everything. Many storage bins will come with label space that will help keep your space organized. If that doesn't work, a bit of painter's tape and a sharpie can do the trick. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Labeling your boxes ensures that you won't have to open each box to find it when you are looking for something. In addition to labels, I also like having dedicated shelves. Knowing that towels are always on the top and detergent is on the bottom helps maintain your new organizing system and creates habits that anyone can follow. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No matter how you choose to organize your space, take it slow, grab a glass of wine, and enjoy the process.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

I often catch myself just staring at it. \u00a0You can choose whatever combination of essential oils you like, or you can swap them around depending on your mood and time of day. Something is calming like peppermint for a meditation or yoga session and maybe some lavender for when you want to curl up on the sofa with a cup of green tea. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Feel free to try out different scents till you find \u2018the one.\u2019 You can also choose to put smaller diffusers around the apartment and in the bathrooms when you\u2019re having guests over.

Take that leap of faith and make this spring season an opportunity to spring clean all aspects of your life.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7582,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/spr6-1024x731.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7582\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cleaning up your life can have several different aspects to it; physical, emotional, and even spiritual. And as you clean up each sphere, you will feel you can breathe a little easier, feel just that bit less anxious.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The easiest place to start is your physical space. It\u2019s tangible, and you will feel the difference almost immediately. A cluttered environment means cluttered thoughts, so the best way to clear up your mind is to clear up your living space. Start with one part of the apartment; your closet would be the best place to start because we all seem to love hoarding clothes, and they might be the easiest items to give away.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7583,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/spr7-1024x678.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7583\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When cleaning your closet, make a general rule in your head. If you haven\u2019t used an item for the last two years, chances are you are not going to be using it again. And plenty of people out there would really appreciate the donation. Tick that \u2018do a good deed today\u2019 check box in your head and start packing that box.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;When that\u2019s done, move to another part and so on. That way, you won\u2019t feel too overwhelmed and feel like you are throwing half your belongings away.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Do away with old pieces of furniture you are no longer using and give yourself the chance to just take in your surroundings. To be honest, minimalism is so underrated. The fewer things you own, the less clutter there is, the less you have to clean up, and the more space and time you can enjoy.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7584,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/sp6-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7584\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spend some time in the kitchen. Get rid of any old saucepans, cups, cutlery that you don\u2019t want to keep.&nbsp; If you are looking to become more focused on good health and using products that are good for the environment, a good place to start might be low-quality plastic containers.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spring cleaning your life also means doing away with anything else in your life that is negatively impacting you. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It could be toxic relationships, a work environment that impacts your mental health, or taking on more than you can handle. Sometimes we end up biting more than we can chew only because we could not say \u2018no\u2019 when we should have. Make use of this time and exercise to step back and reassess what you are comfortable within your current schedule. Make a plan on how to best remove tasks you no longer have the time or energy for.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To be able to feel your best and do your best, you need to make sure your own cup is full. Because remember, you can\u2019t pour out of an empty cup. So make time every day to do something that keeps you going, something that you like doing, just for yourself. It could be a long shower, curling up with a good book, painting or simply sitting with a cup of tea without a list of things to do going on in your mind.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spring clean your biggest asset, your body! Take a good look at your diet. Do you drink enough water? Are you eating a balanced diet? Are there any small steps that you can take to improve your diet and your physical health?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7587,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/spr4-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7587\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A good diet goes hand in hand with some form of exercise. If you are not into doing any intense workouts, try basic yoga to improve your energy levels as well as your mood. Start with just ten minutes a day. You will begin to notice the difference in a few days. Consistency is key. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meditation also works wonders to ease the mind and help with developing awareness. It can improve the quality of your sleep and make you feel more in control of your thoughts.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember, you are your biggest cheerleader. So take some time to write positive notes for yourself and leave them around your apartment; on the bathroom mirror so there is a pick me up note right before you start your day, something on the fridge for you to glance at as your struggle to race through breakfast and something next to your bed, so you can end the day knowing tomorrow can and will be better.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7586,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/spr5-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7586\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Any spring cleaning will be incomplete without a thorough cleaning of your social media accounts. Take some time to out to unfollow people and accounts that end up promoting mindless consumerism and make you feel negative. You don\u2019t need to mindlessly browse through all your stories to find out what is going on in other people\u2019s lives. Because that time can be better spent investing in your own life. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;Don\u2019t be scared to unfriend people you no longer want to be in touch with.&nbsp; And maybe, just maybe, think about clicking that \u2018Deactivate\u2019 button that is glaring at you from your phone screen. Maybe your mind, body and soul need to deactivate from the fa\u00e7ade on social media so you can feel the reality of the cool evening air and the warmth of the coffee mug as it rests in your palms. Try it. You might find it more addictive than the Metaverse.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

But did you know that almost every part of most foods we cook can be used in your garden? From seeds to scraps, there is no such thing as waste when it comes to the products that you cook with.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Starting Seeds Right<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are looking to start or add to your indoor garden, look no further for starters than your fridge! You can start your plants by keeping and planting the seeds from the produce that you use throughout your day. There are a few different ways you can use the seeds; no matter which way you choose, you'll get results with little effort and no waste.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Germinate<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One way of starting your seeds is by letting them germinate. This is an easy process but can make all the difference in how your seeds start and plants take later on. This simply gives the seed a head start to grow some roots before putting it in the dirt.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To germinate, all you need is a paper towel, zipper bags, and some water. Simply cut some paper towels into small strips that will fit inside your bag. Moisten the paper towel, put one seed on one piece, and you can probably fold it over into a square. Place the paper towel with the seed into the bag and seal it.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7616,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-\u2583-1105019-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7616\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can poke a couple of small air holes, but you will get results without. Make sure you keep checking the paper towel daily to ensure it hasn't gone dry; you want to keep the paper towel wet. Within a few days to a week (longer depending on what seed you are planting), roots will appear out of the middle of the seed.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can now plant this germinated seed in dirt and let the plant grow. It is a good idea to germinate because it makes it easier for the seed to get nutrients and moisture from the dirt once it is planted, since the roots are already exposed, rather than waiting for the seed to open planted in dirt.<br><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Plant Seeds Directly<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don't want to or are unable to germinate your seeds, you can plant them directly into the dirt and skip the germination process. You don't have to germinate every seed; most of the seeds you will be planting from your kitchen can be planted directly into the dirt and can do just as well as if you had germinated them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All you have to do is prepare the container where you will be planting or starting the seeds ready with dirt and fertilizer. Place the seeds either into a separate container, or if you are planting more than one together, make sure you space them out to give their roots room to grow. Once the seeds are placed on top of the dirt, you can either cover them with some more dirt or lightly press them into the dirt.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7621,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7621\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You want to make sure that you are careful to keep the seeds wet while they are just starting this way as well, especially if you are skipping the germination process.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure that until you start to see the growth, you want to keep either your germinated seeds or starters wet to help the root grow through the seed shell. You can do this with a spray bottle of water and spray the paper towel squares and the dirt when they start to dry out.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Regrowing Herbs<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great thing that you can use to regrow is the stems from your fresh herbs! Many herbs that we grow and only use the leaf of, such as mint, sage, basil, and many more, can regrow roots from where the leaves and stamps are picked off of.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7617,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7617\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All you have to do is cut off the leaves\/ stems at the bottom of one stem or piece and place it in water.

Once the roots are long and strong enough, you can plant them and enjoy the new addition to your indoor garden!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Home Made Fertilizer &amp; Compost<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Use the rest of the scraps from your kitchen to make your fertilizers and compost to help your plants thrive and save on eliminating food waste. Things like eggshells, used coffee grounds, vegetables, fruit peels, and much more can be used to help the rest of your indoor garden thrive!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Home Made Fertilizer<br>DIY Compost<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the things that I noticed worked best with my indoor garden was using the scraps of my food as compost for later planting purposes. All you have to do is take a bag of soil that reseals (or a container) and continue to throw scraps from your fruits and veggies in with the dirt.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Down the road, when you are ready to plant more or transplant what you have started, you will have beautiful soft nutrient-loaded soil that your plants will love.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7618,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7618\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Egg Shells and Coffee Grounds<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the easiest fertilizers to make is from eggshells and coffee grounds. Simply mix your used coffee grounds and eggshells (instead of throwing them in the garbage anyway) and use this as a fertilizer for your indoor garden. This is a great combination because it helps give them calcium and nitrogen, two things that are essential to giving any plant a healthy boost.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Banana Tea, Anyone?<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another common kitchen scrap that is loaded with nutrients for your garden is banana peels! You can use banana peels as a fertilizer in a few ways. If you have a compost bag going, you can add it to that, or you can make your fertilizer to give your garden a direct boost of potassium, which goes great with the nitrogen and calcium they had from the rest of your breakfast.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a variety of ways out there to make this fertilizer, commonly called banana tea. The easiest way to do this is by making it in a jar. Collect about 3-5 banana peels, depending on the size of your jar; fill the jar with water, seal, and wait. After a few days to about a week, you can remove the banana peels and use the water to water your plants.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Lighting<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the biggest struggles with indoor gardens usually is the lack of natural lighting available. Light is an essential part of your indoor garden's success, so if you can, try to keep them near the window or choose low-light plants to grow.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7619,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7619\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing you can do for your plants, especially when they are just starting, is to get them a \"grow bulb.\" You can get these almost anywhere, dollar stores, hardware stores, and of course, nurseries. This is a bulb or set of bulbs that you put in a designated lamp or light fixture that gives off the proper waves that most plants need.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Pay Attention To Your Gardens Needs<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to our plants, overfeeding and watering our plants is one of the easiest mistakes to make. It can feel like we are doing something wrong when our plants don't need any fertilizer or water, but when it comes to caring for your garden, less is more.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you pay attention to the soil of your garden and the leaves of your plants, you will come to learn when you need to feed and water them. If the top layer of soil is still moist for most plants, you don't need to water it yet; wait until it has dried out a little. Make sure not to overwater your plants, especially sensitive ones such as succulents and cacti.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7620,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7620\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is just as easy to over-fertilize as it is to overfeed. Pay attention to the leaves and stems of your plants; they will tell you if they have had too much or not enough. When it comes to fertilizer when we are recycling our scraps, it is easy for us to overdo it, and you want to be careful that you are paying attention to how much you are feeding them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overfeeding can cause discoloration and other issues to appear on your plants' leaves.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your indoor garden will now not only be as easy as ever, but your plants will grow and thrive more than you dreamed they could if you start to include these great tips in your home gardening routine. Don't just take our word for it. You will see for yourself in no time!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

		"content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is safe to say the spring season is finally here to stay, and after a long winter, Winnipeg is welcoming it warmly! As we transition out of winter and into spring, every Winnipegger knows that with the warm weather comes rain and slush. When it comes to the spring in Winnipeg, the last thing you want to be is unprepared. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While it may feel like you have to compromise on staying fashionable to be able to remain dry in this weather like there is no point in even trying to stay on trend in the rain, snow, and slush. Don't give up on your style just yet! There are lots of great ways to stay dry and remain in head-to-toe fashion this spring without compromising on your 'outfit of the day' likes.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7754,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-jack-redgate-2929277.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7754\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Put Your Best Foot Forward<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to navigating the slushy streets of downtown Winnipeg, having footwear that can trudge through the inevitable slush while still looking fresh is a must for your spring wardrobe. A great pair of waterproof boots or shoes will make all the difference when it comes to beating the weather and still looking great going from outside to inside. You want to make sure that you choose shoes that are made waterproof to avoid damaging a great pair that isn't made to withstand the spring conditions. Most pairs of waterproof shoes are made to resist the snow and slush without damaging the fabric, even without a shoe protector, but you still don't want to skip out on that.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7755,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7755\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Shoe Protector<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No matter what pair of shoes fits your personal style, make sure you keep them protected from the conditions too. Even though most pairs of waterproof shoes can be worn without a protective spray, no problem, when it comes to the fact that you are going through slush and rain, you do want to do what you can to help keep them in the best condition for as long as possible. Using a protecting spray and cleanser that is made for your shoe material will help them resist wear and tear and prevent the fabric from salt and water damage, keeping them looking fresh year after year.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Mukluks<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mukluks are a popular choice in Winnipeg for very good reason. Not only are the traditional Moccasin made perfect for any of Manitoba's conditions, but they also look great and keep you dry and warm in any season. They are great because the rubber sole and waterproof fabrics are made to get you through the worst that mother nature throws at us. I know that I can trust mine to get me from point A to B in the ice and snow or rain and slush without damaging my shoes or my outfit. When it comes to the fur and material of the Mukluks, they are made waterproof to withstand the rain and snow, but you still want to use a protector on these, particularly to keep the fabric and fur in their best condition year after year.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Blundstones<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want something a little more versatile that is great right through from spring to fall, Blundstones and similarly styled shoes are a great option for not only the water and slush, but they are light enough to keep wearing throughout the summer, and it's a bonus that they look great with almost anything. These are fashionable leather ankle boots that are not only trending but versatile. These are a great style when you have to wear them inside and out.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7756,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7756\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Rubber Boots<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rubber boots are a cute classic option when you can't get out of staying in and safe from the rain. Make it dry from door to door dry through puddles and slush. You can't go wrong with a pair of rubber boots in your rainy-day wardrobe. With thousands of cute cuts, styles, and accessories to go with them, you are going to end up wanting to wear your rubber boots this spring.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Rubber Boot Liners<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You don't have to compromise style for functionality on days when you have to wear your rubber boots. Rubber boot liners are a fashionable addition that goes with any style. Most brands and companies like Hunter have helped make wearing rubber boots from drab to fab. Not only do they add an extra soft liner for your boot, so you don't have to walk on rubber, but they look great too.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7758,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Woman wearing hat and jacket\" class=\"wp-image-7758\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Cute Classic Coats<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every spring wardrobe needs a classic coat to complete it. There are many great different styles to choose from when it comes to finding the perfect coat for getting you through the spring conditions dry and in style.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7759,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-liza-summer-6383011-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Two women with jackets talking\" class=\"wp-image-7759\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Long Jackets<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Long water-resistant jackets are a must-have in any spring wardrobe. It goes without saying that a longer coat is the perfect way to keep your outfit safe from the rain and you on the top of your game. There are many cute styles when it comes to long coats, from zip-up, button-up, and classics like the raincoat or trench coat.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Trench Coats<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Trench coats are a timeless classic to keep you and your outfit looking your best. Their waterproof fabric, longer cut, and tie-up waist are a great way to keep your whole outfit dry and heads turning your way.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7763,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-yaroslav-shuraev-8499450-1-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7763\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Classic Rain Coats<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you can't avoid the rain, embrace it! Raincoats are an adorable and practical way to get through the rain and keep your outfit dry without absorbing water itself. You definitely want to keep one in your closet, along with some of these next accessories for a rainy day.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Hats<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another staple of the rainy day wardrobe is, of course, hats! Rain and bucket hats have been making a huge splash with their stylish comeback. Not only are they the missing piece to your rainy-day wardrobe, but they are also one of the staples for staying on trend this season.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7764,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-nataliya-vaitkevich-4813825-2-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7764\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Accessories<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to beating the rain and slush this spring, accessories are key! Winnipeg is known for its unpredictable weather, especially in the spring. We literally have to be prepared to go from snow to rain, and back again all within the same week. Having the right accessories on you could make all the difference in how you, and your clothes, handle the ever-changing spring season.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7765,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-castorly-stock-3836252.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7765\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Umbrella<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The umbrella is something we all think is overrated until it comes time actually to need one. It goes without saying that everyone should have an umbrella on standby in their closet or bag, just in case of unexpected rainfall or drive-by splashes. Anyone who has waited at a bus stop knows exactly what I'm talking about.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Pocket Poncho<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Be prepared for unexpected rainfall with a pocket poncho. These are great to keep in your bag or your car just in case you are caught in the rain, without a jacket or umbrella. They have come a long way from the plastic bag look they used to come in. You can find many fashionable options that you will actually want to wear that you'll be glad you have on you when you do have to wear them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spring is one of the most fashionable times of the year, but it can be hard to stay that way when it is almost one of the messiest times of the year. But with these great pieces in your wardrobe, you will be ready for anything without having to compromise on style. It's easy to make the most of the beautiful spring season while navigating through the slushy streets of Winnipeg when your outfit of the day can keep up with our ever-changing conditions as the weather is getting warmer.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

A great option is using handkerchiefs and pocket scarves as they are an easy-to-find, affordable, and one-of-a-kind idea when it comes to making a wreath.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Specialized Bouquets<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7788,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7788\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another great DIY gift idea you can customize for your mom that she will love is a flower box bouquet. Show your mom not only how much she means to you but how well you know her with a personalized bouquet. Nothing says Happy Mother\u2019s Day like realizing their baby really does know and love them back (almost) as much as they know and love us.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Show your mom how much you with a personalized bouquet. These personalized DIY bouquets are a perfect fit for Mother\u2019s Day.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Crystal Bouquets<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you or your mom is into crystals, this is a great idea. Not only is it sentimental to put it into a bouquet, but crystals are also incredibly beautiful and personal when it comes from the right person. If your mom likes crystals, the great idea is to go to a holistic store (or order a set on amazon) and pick out a few of your favorite crystals that you know your Mom would love. This is one of the most affordable yet thoughtful ideas when it comes to the DIY gift department.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7786,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7786\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you aren't sure what a crystal is or what to buy, here are some suggestions that fit the energy of Mother\u2019s Day. It is never a bad idea to grab some dried herbs and fresh flowers to throw in and fill the spaces and really make your bouquet complete. You can go to your local metaphysical store or order them online from many holistic realters (amazon included). The great thing about these bouquets is you can make them specific to your mom's life, needs, and personality. If you are not quite sure where to start with the crystals and do not want to ruin the surprise by asking her yourself, here are some fail-safe favorites she will definitely love:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Rose Quartz<\/li><li>Amethyst<\/li><li>Citrine<\/li><li>Tigers Eye<\/li><li>Turquoise<\/li><li>Clear Quartz<\/li><li>Tigers Eye<\/li><li>Rainbow Fluorite<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Edible Bouquets<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another delicious bouquet idea is an edible bouquet! If you ask any mom, they would probably rather have chocolates than actual flowers. A traditional gift like flowers is a nice thought, but they wilt all too soon. Give your Mother\u2019s Day gift a tasty appetizer with a chocolate or cookie bouquet, picked fresh for your own Mom's taste.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7785,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7785\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a great and easy thing to pull off, no matter your DIY skill, because baking is optional. Put together some of your mom\u2019s favorite cookies, chocolates, and other treats and arrange them in her own \u201csnack bouquet.\u201d<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Photo Bouquet<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A great bouquet option that you can personalize with your mom is a photo bouquet! Print out some of your favorite photos of your mom or you and her together, and turn them into a personal bouquet! <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7784,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7784\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She will certainly love the thought and personality put behind it and the fact that she has printouts of the two of you.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>DIY Self Care Box<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moms work way too hard even now that we grow older; our moms are still able to grace us with their motherly wisdom at every text and call.

Check out these famous suspension bridges and waterfalls with the choice between the smaller Rotary bridge in Minnedosa or the record-breaking swing bridge in Souris.

Being one of the focal points of our homes, many of us strive to create the 'perfect' bedroom. But when it comes to designing our bedrooms, it can be hard to know where to start. What do you need, what should you think of, are you forgetting anything, what is considered \"the best\" bedroom set up anyways?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7931,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bedroom2-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7931\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is no exact formula for the best bedroom when designing the perfect bedroom because each space, personality, and lifestyle is different, and you have to do your best with what you can do. When living in a rental property, it may seem like it isn't much you can do if you are limited by not being able to paint or change too much. You can turn any space into the perfect bedroom with a few key tips, no matter your bedroom situation.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Colors &amp; Textures<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to the overall aesthetic design of your bedroom, you want to consider your colors and textures first. If you are planning to paint, make sure you choose your colors carefully and consider the color scheme of one of the next major features in the room, like your bedding or rug.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7932,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bedroom3-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7932\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You want to go with<a href=\"https:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/b\/Paint-Ideas\/Popular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> colors that complement each other<\/a> without being overbearing. If you already have a common color throughout the room, you might want to choose one that compliments the things you already have. You want to go with colors that are the more neutral, darker, or lighter tones than the colors you will be working with; this compliments your bright colors without using the same ones and being too much.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For textures, you want to be mindful that you are adding the right ones, but you want to avoid having too many. Textures include things like your rug, pillows, blankets, and patterns. These are all things that have and create their texture, and you want to make sure you choose the same or complementary and not add too many.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7929,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7929\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you aren't painting, having white walls in your bedroom is a great way to trick the eye into feeling like the space is bigger than it is. If you have a smaller space, it might be better to go with white to make the space feel larger, whereas, in a small room, the wrong or too many colors can make the space feel cramped.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Having the right Frame in Mind<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next thing you want to consider is your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.structube.com\/en_ca\/furniture\/bedroom?page=1&amp;sort-by=position-asc&amp;category_id%5Bfilter%5D=Beds%2C503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> bed frame<\/a>. If you will be getting a new bed frame, it is essential to think about the space and what you need when choosing one. One thing you can never have enough of in a bedroom is storage space.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7928,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bedroom12-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7928\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> So if you are low on available closet space or don't have room for dressers, then this could be a great solution for you.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Pick the Best Nightstand<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having the right bedside table makes all the difference. Not only is it going to be a great accent of style in your room, but it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eq3.com\/ca\/en\/category\/bedroom\/storage\/nightstands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one piece of furniture that we all need<\/a>, no matter what kind of space you are working with. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7925,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/pexels-pnw-production-8251682-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7925\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When picking the perfect nightstand, you want to consider the overall style and tone of your room. You want to pick something that goes with the theme, looks good, and holds whatever you need.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Less Is More<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to the perfect bedroom, one thing you don't want to do is overthink or overcrowd it. The bedroom is the perfect room to use minimalism. The less furniture, accessories, and clutter you have lying around your room, the better.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7924,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bedroom6-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7924\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the way things are today, our bedrooms are starting to turn into the space where we spend the most time and maybe even get the most work done, so that may not always be an option. If you do have to have things like a desk, electronics, and your collectibles in your room, you can still use the less is more approach. Display things like trinkets and collections on floating shelves rather than taking up surface space on your dresser, desk, and side tables.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Room Dividers<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have to have an office space in your bedroom, it is not only a useful design trick that both helps cut the visual clutter but also the mental clutter. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/ca\/en\/p\/risoer-room-divider-white-black-70182191\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A room divider<\/a> is a helpful trick to help you focus by eliminating other distractions in your room while working on your desk without getting distracted with laundry, tv, and bed.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7923,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bedroom1-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7923\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Room dividers are a great design tool that you can utilize when designing your room.

But as the gentrification of downtown Winnipeg and the Exchange District gains momentum, more and more small businesses are popping up. Quaintly nestled within the large historic buildings of the downtown area, some of these shops are easy to miss if you don\u2019t know where to look. Those with an eye for fashion might want to keep an eye out for these hidden fashion boutiques downtown and in the Exchange District.\n<h3>Lennard Taylor<\/h3>\n246 McDermot Avenue\nSince 2015\n\nThis clothing store bears the name of its young designer.

That\u2019s a tribute to how hidden it is. This store is located at 407 Graham Avenue and is the thirds of its chain to open in Canada, following a store in Vancouver and another in Toronto. Livestock specializes in sneakers and modern streetwear. It\u2019s unquestionably a top stop for the sneakerhead, or for anyone on a serious hunt for a pair of fashionable sneakers. Livestock Winnipeg carries men\u2019s\/unisex clothing in-store and a smaller selection of women\u2019s clothing online.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.deadstock.ca\/\">www.deadstock.ca<\/a>\n<h3>Boutique Anya<\/h3>\n88 Albert St.\nSince 2015\n\nThis little shop is locally owned and operated by designer Alicja Dalecki.

Much of the time, dogs are barking out of curiosity, and you can help them stop barking at the same things in the future by teaching them what the sounds are. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":9941,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bark1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9941\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, if your dog is triggered by noise in the hall, let your dog watch what is making the noise. If your dog barks at people in the hallway, it is helpful to try and let your dog meet as many of your neighbors as possible.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Likely your pet barks at your next-door neighbors the most since they're the closest, and your dog can't always tell if it's their door or yours. So, if your neighbor and your dog are both friendly, try a meet and greet as they're coming and going so your dog gets familiar with them and stops barking at them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Training Exercise<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that your dog is familiar with the white noise and people of your building, start training them on the sound of your next-door neighbors if that's a problem area for your dog.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Have your neighbor leave and come back and work on how your dog reacts. When your dog starts to react to the noise of your neighbor, start by getting your dog to sit and work up to add in your own 'no barking command'.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":9942,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9942\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When your dog hears them and starts to react, get them to sit and stay. Open your door, so your dog can associate the sound with the person. Now that your dog knows that the sound of the keys in the lock next door is just your friendly neighbor who isn't a threat, they will start barking less.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Repeat the exercise; this time, don't open the door right away. Ask your dog to sit and use your no-barking command to get the dog to sit and try to be quiet before opening the door. Your dog probably knows who is on the other side of the door if you do this a few times in a row, so it is important to do this outside of your training exercise as well. As your dog starts to change his reactions, keep refreshing the training and rewarding their efforts.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Barking at Your Door<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next situation you want to train your dog in is when there is a knock on your door. Since your dog thinks he is doing his job by reporting every noise to you, it is important to teach him which noises to look out for and how to react to them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":9946,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bark7-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9946\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have observed how they are reacting and you have decided how you want them trained, it's time to work on replacing their barking with that reaction instead. Training is most effective if you can dedicate time out each day for your dog where you are going to work on the specific things, rather than just trying to correct the behavior as it pops up.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first thing you want to do is get their attention by having them sit. Once they're sitting, work on getting them to stop barking using your designated command. Reward them for sitting and for any efforts made to stop barking at your word.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have them trained to stop barking on command try to repeat the situation a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.petsmart.ca\/dog\/treats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nd reward them for stopping a few times in a row<\/a>. Try to avoid calling your dog badly, focus on rewarding for changed behavior instead. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":9948,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bark5-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9948\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In time, your dog will learn to ignore the noises entirely. Once your dog is more used to everything and you start training, you can begin to train them on how they are barking at your company and at you.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Knock Training<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next thing you want to train them on is knocks on the door. A big reason why dogs bark is they think you or someone else is at the door. So, you want to teach them how to tell the differences and how you want them to act. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The best way of doing this is with knock training for when the company is at the door and for when you are coming home.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>When It's Company<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Have a friend stand on the other side of the closed door with you and your dog inside. Have them knock on the door, and you train your dog on how you want them to react to someone knocking on the door. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ideally, you want to start with training them to sit and get them to stop barking using their newly taught word.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":9947,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bark8-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9947\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Observe<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Get your friend to knock, and you observe your dog's reaction, try to resist intervening or saying a command, and wait out until they are done, if possible.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Introduce<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Introduce your dog to what is making the sound. Show your dog that it is actually someone at your door that they are responding to. Don't open the door but acknowledge that your dog is alerting you about someone. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, you want to get them to sit and if you can, stop barking using your word before you open the door. If they still are barking, continue training.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Replace<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, you want to do is replace the reaction with what you are teaching them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Repeat your friend knocking and your dog sitting with rewards a few times in a row. Once they are sitting for you, as a reaction, you can teach them a command to go with it that tells them to stop or not to bark when there is a knock at the door.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":9945,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bark9-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9945\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Have your friend knock again, and when your dog barks, have them sit and tell them the command. Encourage them to stop barking with that command and once your dog stops barking, say the command and praise them, so they associate the word with being quiet and being quiet with praise and reward.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Repeat &amp; Reward<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some dogs pick it up right away; others may need a few more training days or weeks. It is important to keep training consistent until your dog does get it before they start to go back to their old behavior. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/7-fun-ways-to-celebrate-halloween-with-your-dog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dogs respond much better to praise and reward<\/a>. Make sure you mix up the rewards for your dog with treats, pets, and getting to play with a toy.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>When It's You<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to training your dog to not bark when you are at the door, you want to do a similar exercise.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Practice walking up, knocking, putting the keys in, whatever makes your dog bark when you come home, and start with teaching them to replace the behavior with sitting and the quiet command.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>You want to avoid punishing your dog for barking,<\/strong> especially while you are training them. If your dog feels like you are getting angry at them for barking, this may make your dog's barking or other reactions worse and harder to train.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":9944,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/livingat300main.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bark2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9944\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Continue to praise them for the following days to a couple of weeks while they are still fresh with it. Remember, when it comes to changing behavior like barking with your dog, consistency, praise, and patience are key.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dog is only as smart as you make them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Training your dog how to react when it is you helps them tell the difference between strangers and you when they are home alone. This will help your dog be more relaxed towards people in the hallway passing by and your neighbors coming and going while you are out as it teaches your dog to recognize when you are home and when it's just someone passing by.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is important to remember that your dog is only as trained as you let them be. Every dog is different. There is no magic number of times or amount of time until your dog is totally trained in this way. Usually, a behavior like barking can take a few weeks. Just remember to be persistent and patient!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",
